# Contributing to MeshHook

Thank you for your interest in contributing to MeshHook! This guide will help you get started with contributing to our webhook-first workflow engine.

## About MeshHook

MeshHook is an MIT-licensed, webhook-first workflow engine with a visual builder and Temporal-like durability via event sourcing on Postgres. We mesh your webhooks and orchestrate everything with simplicity, durability, and security.

---

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- **Node.js** (v18 or later) or **Bun**
- **pnpm** (recommended package manager)
- **Git**
- **Supabase CLI** (`pnpm install -g supabase`)
- **Docker** (for local Supabase)

### Setting Up Your Development Environment

**1. Fork and clone**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/meshhook.git
cd meshhook
```

**2. Install dependencies**
```bash
pnpm install
```

**3. Setup environment**
```bash
pnpm run setup
```
Select "Local Development" when prompted.

**4. Start Supabase locally**
```bash
pnpx supabase start
```

**5. Run database migrations**
```bash
pnpm run db:migrate
```

**6. Start the orchestrator**
```bash
pnpm run start
```

Your local instance should now be running at `http://localhost:8080`

### Tech Stack

- **UI/API**: SvelteKit (Svelte 5)
- **Database/Queues/Realtime/Storage**: Supabase (Postgres)
- **Workers**: Node.js or Bun (stateless)
- **Queue**: pg-boss or pgmq (Postgres-native)
- **Transforms**: JMESPath
- **Single Service**: All components run on port 8080

## ðŸ“‹ Style Guide

### JavaScript/TypeScript

- Use **TypeScript** for new code
- Use `const` and `let`, avoid `var`
- Prefer arrow functions for callbacks
- Use async/await over raw promises
- Name variables descriptively (avoid single letters except in loops)
- Add JSDoc comments for functions and complex logic

### Svelte 5

- Use **Svelte 5 runes** (`$state`, `$derived`, `$effect`)
- Keep components small and focused
- Use TypeScript in script blocks
- Follow reactive programming patterns
- Extract reusable logic into composables

### CSS

- Use **Tailwind CSS** utility classes when possible
- For custom styles, use component-scoped CSS
- Follow mobile-first responsive design
- Maintain consistent spacing using Tailwind's scale

### Database & Event Sourcing

- Use **Postgres-native** features whenever possible
- Follow event sourcing patterns for workflow state
- Use pg-boss or pgmq for queue operations
- Leverage Supabase Realtime for live updates
- Write efficient queries, considering partitioning strategy

### JMESPath Transforms

- Keep transforms simple and readable
- Add comments explaining complex expressions
- Test transforms with sample data
- Document expected input/output structures

---

## Community Standards

### Code of Conduct

We are committed to providing a welcoming and inclusive environment. We expect all contributors to:

- **Be respectful** - Treat everyone with kindness and empathy
- **Be collaborative** - Work together, share knowledge, help others
- **Be patient** - Remember that everyone is learning
- **Be constructive** - Provide helpful feedback, focus on solutions
- **Be inclusive** - Welcome people of all backgrounds and skill levels

### Communication

- **GitHub Issues** - For bug reports and feature requests
- **Pull Request comments** - For code-specific discussions
- **Project discussions** - For general questions and ideas

### Reporting Issues

When reporting a bug, please include:
- Clear description of the issue
- Steps to reproduce
- Expected vs actual behavior
- Environment details (OS, Node version, Supabase version)

---

## ðŸ”’ Security

- **Never commit sensitive information** (API keys, passwords, tokens, Supabase credentials)
- Use environment variables for all configuration
- `.env.staging` and `.env.production` are **not committed** to the repository
- Report security vulnerabilities privately to the maintainers
- Follow security best practices in webhook handling and data transformations

---

## âœ… Testing

Before submitting a PR:
- Test locally with `pnpm run start`
- Verify migrations work: `pnpm run db:migrate`
- Test webhook intake and workflow execution
- Check for linting errors: `pnpm run lint`
- Verify that existing functionality still works
- Test with both local Supabase and remote instances (if possible)

---

## ðŸ“š Documentation

When adding new features:
- Update relevant documentation in `./docs/`
- Add code comments for complex logic
- Update PlantUML diagrams if architecture changes
- Add examples for new webhook integrations or transforms
- Update the README if necessary
