# PRD: Database Schema Documentation

**Issue:** [#193](https://github.com/profullstack/meshhook/issues/193)  
**Milestone:** Phase 8: Documentation  
**Labels:** developer-documentation, hacktoberfest  
**Phase:** Phase 8  
**Section:** Developer Documentation  

---

## Overview

The purpose of this task is to create comprehensive documentation for the MeshHook project's database schema. This documentation is crucial for enabling developers to understand the project's data model, contributing to better development, integration, and maintenance processes. Given MeshHook's commitment to providing a webhook-first, deterministic, Postgres-native workflow engine, the database schema forms the backbone of the application, making its documentation vital for the project's success.

This task aligns with MeshHook's goals by ensuring that the project's infrastructure is transparent and accessible, thereby facilitating future enhancements and integrations. It supports core functionalities such as webhook triggers, visual DAG building, durable runs, live logs, and multi-tenant security by providing a clear understanding of how data is structured and managed.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

1. **Comprehensive Schema Documentation:** Document all database tables, columns, data types, constraints, indexes, and relationships.
2. **Normalization and RLS Policies:** Documentation must include normalization details and row-level security (RLS) policies to ensure multi-tenant security.
3. **Indexing and Performance:** Include documentation on indexing strategies for query optimization and performance enhancement.
4. **Versioning:** Manage schema documentation in version control with clear versioning for tracking changes over time.
5. **Integration Guidelines:** Provide guidelines for integrating new tables or modifying existing ones within the current schema.

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **Accuracy:** Ensure that the documentation precisely reflects the current state of the database schema.
- **Usability:** Documentation should be clear, well-structured, and easy to navigate for developers and new contributors.
- **Maintainability:** The documentation process should be easily repeatable, allowing for updates as the schema evolves.
- **Accessibility:** Host the documentation in a location accessible to all project contributors, with considerations for different roles and permissions.

## Technical Specifications

### Architecture Context

MeshHook utilizes a Postgres database managed by Supabase, which includes data storage, queues, and real-time log streaming. The database schema is central to the orchestration of workflows, handling webhook triggers, storing workflow definitions, and managing execution logs.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Review Existing Schema:** Begin by reviewing the current `schema.sql` file and any related migrations to understand the existing database structure.
2. **Tool Selection:** Choose tools for generating schema documentation. Options include automated database documentation tools or manual documentation approaches, depending on the project's needs and the complexity of the schema.
3. **Generate Initial Documentation:** Use the selected tool or process to create the initial version of the schema documentation. This should include tables, columns, data types, constraints, relationships, indexes, and RLS policies.
4. **Review and Revise:** Review the generated documentation for accuracy, completeness, and clarity. Make necessary revisions to ensure it meets the project's standards and requirements.
5. **Publish Documentation:** Finalize the documentation and publish it in an accessible location, such as the project's GitHub wiki or a dedicated documentation site. Ensure it is linked from the main project documentation for easy access.
6. **Update Process:** Establish a process for updating the documentation when the database schema changes, integrating this process into the project's workflow to ensure ongoing accuracy.

### Data Model Changes

Not applicable for this task, as it focuses on documenting the existing schema rather than modifying it.

### API Endpoints

Not applicable for this task.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Database schema documentation is complete, including tables, columns, data types, constraints, relationships, indexes, and RLS policies.
- [ ] Documentation is reviewed for accuracy and clarity.
- [ ] Documentation is published in an accessible location and linked from the main project documentation.
- [ ] A process for updating the documentation is established and documented.

## Dependencies and Prerequisites

- Access to the current database schema (`schema.sql` and any migration files).
- Selection of a documentation tool or approach suitable for the project's needs.
- Access to a platform for hosting the documentation (e.g., GitHub wiki, dedicated documentation site).

## Implementation Notes

### Development Guidelines

- Ensure that the documentation process is in line with the project's coding standards and best practices.
- Use clear, concise language and provide examples where applicable to enhance understanding.

### Testing Strategy

- Validate the accuracy of the documentation by cross-referencing with the actual database schema.
- Conduct peer reviews of the documentation to ensure clarity and completeness.

### Security Considerations

- Ensure that RLS policies and any other security-related aspects of the schema are thoroughly documented.
- Be mindful of not including any sensitive information or credentials in the documentation.

### Monitoring and Observability

Not directly applicable to this task, but ensure that any aspects of the schema related to logging, metrics, and monitoring are accurately documented.
