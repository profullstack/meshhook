# PRD: Database Schema Documentation for MeshHook

## Overview

The MeshHook project, a webhook-first, deterministic, Postgres-native workflow engine, requires comprehensive documentation of its database schema to facilitate understanding, development, integration, and maintenance by developers. This documentation is pivotal for enhancing the clarity and efficiency of working with MeshHook's underlying data model, which supports key features like webhook triggers, visual DAG building, durable runs, live logs, and multi-tenant security through row-level security (RLS) policies.

## Objectives

- To create detailed documentation of the MeshHook database schema.
- To ensure the documentation supports the project's transparency, ease of development, and future scalability.

## Functional Requirements

1. **Schema Overview**: Document all entities in the database, including tables, views, stored procedures, and functions.
2. **Column Details**: For each table, document column names, data types, default values, and constraints (primary keys, foreign keys, unique constraints).
3. **Indexes and Performance**: Document existing indexes, their types (e.g., B-tree, hash, GIN, GiST), and their intended performance optimizations.
4. **Normalization**: Describe the normalization level of the database schema and the rationale behind the chosen normalization strategy.
5. **Row-Level Security (RLS) Policies**: Document existing RLS policies, including the conditions under which they apply and their impact on multi-tenancy.
6. **Version Control**: Ensure all documentation is version-controlled, including a changelog to track modifications over time.

## Non-Functional Requirements

- **Accuracy**: The documentation must accurately reflect the current database schema.
- **Clarity**: The documentation should be clear and understandable, even to new contributors.
- **Maintainability**: The process for updating the documentation must be straightforward and documented.
- **Accessibility**: Ensure the documentation is easily accessible to all project contributors.

## Technical Specifications

### Architecture Context

MeshHook leverages a Postgres database managed by Supabase, supporting features like durable workflow runs, real-time log streaming, and multi-tenant security. The database schema is crucial for these capabilities, necessitating clear and comprehensive documentation.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Schema Review**: Start with a thorough review of the current `schema.sql` file and any relevant migration scripts to fully understand the existing database structure.
2. **Documentation Tool Selection**: Select appropriate tools for schema documentation. Automated tools like dbdocs.io or SchemaSpy can be considered for initial generation, supplemented by manual review and editing.
3. **Initial Documentation Generation**: Generate the first version of the schema documentation, covering all aspects outlined in the functional requirements.
4. **Documentation Review and Revision**: Carefully review the generated documentation for accuracy and completeness. Revise as necessary to meet quality standards.
5. **Publishing**: Publish the finalized documentation in an accessible format and location, such as the project's GitHub wiki or documentation website, ensuring it's linked from the main project documentation.
6. **Maintenance Process**: Develop and document a process for regularly updating the documentation to reflect schema changes, integrating this process into the project's development workflow.

### Data Model Changes

- Not applicable, as this task focuses on documenting the existing database schema.

### API Endpoints

- Not applicable.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All database entities (tables, views, stored procedures, functions) are documented, including columns, data types, constraints, and indexes.
- [ ] RLS policies are clearly documented, explaining their application and impact.
- [ ] The documentation accurately reflects the current state of the database schema.
- [ ] The documentation is published in an accessible location and linked from the main project documentation.
- [ ] A maintenance process for the documentation is established and documented.

## Dependencies and Prerequisites

- Access to the current database schema and any relevant documentation.
- Selection of a documentation tool or method that meets the project's needs.
- Access to a hosting solution for the documentation.

## Implementation Notes

### Development Guidelines

- Follow the project's code style and documentation standards.
- Use diagrams where applicable to illustrate relationships and flows.

### Testing Strategy

- Cross-reference the documentation against the actual database schema to ensure accuracy.
- Peer review the documentation for clarity and completeness.

### Security Considerations

- Ensure that the documentation of RLS policies and any security mechanisms is comprehensive.
- Avoid including sensitive information in the documentation.

### Monitoring and Observability

- While not directly related to this task, ensure any aspects related to monitoring and logging are accurately represented in relation to their database components.
