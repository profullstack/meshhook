# PRD: Worker Logic Tests

## Overview

This PRD details the implementation and validation of unit tests for the worker logic within MeshHook, a webhook-first, deterministic, Postgres-native workflow engine. The worker logic is a core component responsible for the processing of webhook events, the execution of workflow steps, and the handling of retries and errors. By establishing a comprehensive suite of unit tests, we aim to ensure the reliability, correctness, and security of the worker logic, in line with MeshHook's objectives of durability, replayability, and multi-tenant security.

## Functional Requirements

1. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Develop unit tests that cover all aspects of the worker logic, including event processing, workflow step execution, error handling, retries, and signature verification.
2. **Scenario-Based Testing**: Create tests for a variety of scenarios, including but not limited to:
   - Successful processing of events and execution of workflow steps.
   - Failure modes such as network failures, processing errors, and invalid inputs.
   - Retry mechanisms and their backoff strategies under various failure conditions.
   - Signature verification processes and other security checks.
3. **Mocking External Dependencies**: Implement mocking for external services and systems to ensure tests are deterministic and can run in isolation.
4. **Documentation**: Each test case should be well-documented, explaining its purpose, the scenario it tests, and any specific setup required.

## Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance**: Unit tests should be lightweight and fast to execute, facilitating quick feedback during development cycles and CI/CD processes.
- **Reliability**: Tests must consistently yield the same results under the same conditions to be reliable indicators of code health and functionality.
- **Security**: Testing should also cover security aspects of the worker logic, ensuring robust input validation and adherence to security protocols.
- **Maintainability**: Test code should be clear, concise, and maintainable, adhering to the project's coding standards and best practices.

## Technical Specifications

### Architecture Context

MeshHook's architecture leverages SvelteKit for frontend operations, Supabase for real-time updates and backend storage, and a distributed system of worker processes for handling webhook events and executing workflow logic. The worker logic tests must integrate seamlessly into this architecture, focusing on the isolated testing of the worker processes' logic.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Analysis**: Review the existing worker logic code to identify all functionalities and interactions that require testing.
2. **Design Test Cases**: Create detailed test cases for each identified functionality, considering various scenarios and edge cases.
3. **Setup Testing Environment**: Utilize a JavaScript testing framework (e.g., Jest) and prepare necessary mocking libraries (e.g., Sinon or jest-mock) to simulate external dependencies.
4. **Implement Unit Tests**: Write tests according to the designed test cases, ensuring each test is isolated and focuses on a single functionality or behavior.
5. **Execution and Refinement**: Run the tests to identify failures and refine them as necessary to ensure comprehensive coverage and accuracy.
6. **Integration and Documentation**: Integrate the test suite with the project's existing CI/CD pipeline for automated execution and update project documentation to include guidelines on running and extending the unit tests.

### Data Model Changes

Not applicable for this task, as it focuses on testing existing logic without altering the data model.

### API Endpoints

Not applicable, as this task is centered around internal logic testing rather than API interaction.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Comprehensive test cases for all identified functionalities of the worker logic are implemented and documented.
- [ ] The test suite covers various scenarios, including success paths, error conditions, and edge cases.
- [ ] All unit tests pass consistently and demonstrate the reliability and correctness of the worker logic.
- [ ] The test suite is integrated into the project's CI/CD pipeline for automated execution.
- [ ] Documentation is updated with instructions for running and extending the unit tests.

## Dependencies

- Access to the MeshHook codebase, specifically the worker logic components.
- Availability of JavaScript testing and mocking frameworks (e.g., Jest, Sinon).
- Knowledge of the project's existing code structure, style guidelines, and testing conventions.

## Implementation Notes

### Development Guidelines

- Adhere to MeshHook's coding standards and best practices for test development.
- Write clear, concise test cases focusing on readability and maintainability.
- Utilize modern JavaScript/ES6+ features for more efficient and understandable test code.

### Testing Strategy

- Prioritize unit testing for isolating and testing individual components of the worker logic.
- Employ mocking to simulate external systems and dependencies, ensuring tests are self-contained.
- Where possible, run tests in parallel to minimize execution time and facilitate quicker feedback loops.

### Security Considerations

- Ensure that tests do not inadvertently expose sensitive information or compromise security protocols.
- Include tests specifically designed to validate the security mechanisms of the worker logic, such as input validation and authentication checks.

### Monitoring & Observability

While not directly related to the task of writing unit tests, ensure that any modifications or enhancements to the worker logic made in response to test findings are aligned with MeshHook's monitoring and observability practices. This includes appropriate logging and error handling that can aid in the ongoing observation and maintenance of the system.
