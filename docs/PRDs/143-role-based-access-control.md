# PRD: Role-based Access Control

## Overview

The implementation of Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is a critical feature for enhancing the security and flexibility of the MeshHook platform. By enabling fine-grained access control, MeshHook can offer users tailored access to resources and operations based on their roles within an organization. This feature aligns with MeshHook's core goals of multi-tenant RLS security and robust authentication and authorization mechanisms.

**Objectives:**
- To ensure secure and flexible access control to different parts of the MeshHook platform.
- To align with MeshHook's commitment to security, scalability, and user-centric design.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

1. **Role Definition:** Implement the ability to define roles with specific permissions.
2. **User-Role Assignment:** Allow for the assignment of roles to users.
3. **Permission Checks:** Integrate permission checks into API endpoints and UI components.
4. **Role Management API:** Provide APIs for creating, reading, updating, and deleting roles.
5. **Auditing:** Log all role management activities for auditing purposes.

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** Role resolution and permission checking should not significantly impact response times.
- **Reliability:** Ensure high availability of role management and enforcement mechanisms.
- **Security:** Implement robust validation and sanitization to prevent injection attacks and unauthorized access.
- **Maintainability:** Code should be modular, well-documented, and easy to extend with new roles and permissions.

## Technical Specifications

### Architecture Context

MeshHook uses a combination of SvelteKit for the frontend and Supabase (Postgres) for backend services, including data storage and real-time updates. Role-based access control requires integration at both the API layer for backend enforcement and the UI layer for frontend display and management.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Analysis:** Examine current authentication flows and identify areas requiring integration with RBAC.
2. **Design:**
   - Define a `roles` table in Postgres to store role definitions and permissions.
   - Update the `users` table schema to include role assignments.
   - Design API endpoints for role management.
   - Plan integration with existing frontend components for role management UI.
3. **Implementation:**
   - Implement backend logic for RBAC, including database models, API endpoints, and permission checks.
   - Add frontend components for role management and enforce visibility and access based on roles.
4. **Integration:** Ensure RBAC logic is integrated with existing authentication and authorization flows.
5. **Testing:** Perform thorough testing, including unit, integration, and E2E tests for RBAC features.
6. **Documentation:** Update project documentation to reflect RBAC capabilities and usage.

### Data Model

- **Roles Table:** `id`, `name`, `permissions` (JSONB to store permission definitions).
- **User Roles Relation:** Add a `role_id` foreign key to the `users` table or create a join table if many-to-many relations are needed.

### API Endpoints

- **POST /roles**: Create a new role.
- **GET /roles**: List all roles.
- **GET /roles/{id}**: Get details of a specific role.
- **PUT /roles/{id}**: Update a role.
- **DELETE /roles/{id}**: Delete a role.
- **POST /users/{userId}/roles/{roleId}**: Assign a role to a user.
- **DELETE /users/{userId}/roles/{roleId}**: Remove a role from a user.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Role management APIs implemented and functioning as expected.
- [ ] Users can be assigned roles, and these roles dictate access levels.
- [ ] Permission checks are implemented and integrated into the existing system without significant performance degradation.
- [ ] Frontend components for role management are implemented and user-friendly.
- [ ] All new code is covered by tests (unit, integration, and, where applicable, E2E).
- [ ] Documentation is updated to include details on role management and assignment.
- [ ] Security reviews have been conducted, focusing on RBAC implementation.

## Dependencies

- Access to the current MeshHook codebase and development environment.
- Supabase (Postgres) for backend storage.

## Implementation Notes

### Development Guidelines

- Follow the existing project structure and coding standards.
- Implement RBAC in a modular way to allow for extensibility.
- Use environment variables for configuration to facilitate deployment in different environments.

### Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests:** Focus on model logic and permission resolution.
- **Integration Tests:** Test API endpoints and their integration with the frontend.
- **E2E Tests:** Simulate user interactions with the role management UI and validate access control across the application.

### Security Considerations

- Validate and sanitize all inputs to the role management APIs.
- Ensure that role management APIs are accessible only to authenticated users with administrative privileges.
- Use parameterized queries to interact with the database and prevent SQL injection.

### Monitoring & Observability

- Log all role management operations for auditing purposes.
- Monitor API response times and error rates to ensure RBAC does not negatively impact performance.
- Set up alerts for critical RBAC failures or unauthorized access attempts.
