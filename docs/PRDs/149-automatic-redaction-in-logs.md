# PRD: Automatic Redaction in Logs

## 1. Overview

### 1.1 Purpose

The objective of this task is to enhance the security and privacy of the MeshHook workflow engine by implementing automatic redaction of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) in logs. This feature aligns with our commitment to security, privacy, and compliance, ensuring that sensitive information is protected across all operational logs.

### 1.2 Alignment with Project Goals

This task directly supports MeshHook's core goals by enhancing the security layer of our multi-tenant architecture and ensuring that our logging mechanisms adhere to best practices for PII handling. By integrating automatic redaction capabilities, we further solidify our promise of providing a secure, reliable, and privacy-compliant workflow engine.

## 2. Functional Requirements

1. **Automatic Detection and Redaction:** The system must automatically detect and redact PII information from all log entries before they are stored or displayed.
2. **Customizable Redaction Rules:** Support customizable redaction rules to allow for the flexibility of defining what constitutes PII, accommodating different regulatory requirements.
3. **Audit Trail:** Maintain an audit trail of redaction actions, including metadata about the redaction without storing the redacted information.
4. **Minimal Performance Impact:** Implement the redaction mechanism in a way that minimizes the impact on logging performance.
5. **API Documentation:** Update the API documentation to include details about the redaction process, available customization, and configuration options.

## 3. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** Ensure that the log redaction process adds no more than a 10% overhead to the log processing time.
- **Reliability:** Guarantee a 99.9% success rate in detecting and redacting PII from logs.
- **Security:** Adhere to the latest security standards for PII detection and redaction, ensuring that redacted logs cannot be reverse-engineered to expose sensitive information.
- **Maintainability:** Code related to log redaction should be modular, well-documented, and easy to update or extend with new rules.

## 4. Technical Specifications

### 4.1 Architecture Context

- **Integration Points:**
  - Supabase Realtime for log streaming.
  - Existing logging mechanisms within the SvelteKit (SSR/API) components and Workers.
- **Components Affected:**
  - Logging services.
  - Database schema for storing redaction rules and audit trails.

### 4.2 Implementation Approach

1. **Analysis:** Evaluate current logging mechanisms to identify where and how logs are generated, stored, and streamed.
2. **Design:**
   - Define a schema for storing redaction rules in Postgres.
   - Design an audit trail mechanism for tracking redactions.
   - Outline the architecture for intercepting and processing logs for PII before storage/display.
3. **Implementation:**
   - Implement the redaction engine, integrating it into the current logging flow.
   - Create a management API for redaction rules.
   - Update logging mechanisms to support asynchronous redaction where necessary.
4. **Testing and Documentation:** Write tests covering all new functionality and update documentation accordingly.

### 4.3 Data Model Changes

- New table `log_redaction_rules` for storing redaction patterns and rules.
- New table `log_redaction_audit` for storing redaction audit trails.

### 4.4 API Endpoints

- `POST /api/redaction-rules`: Create new redaction rule.
- `GET /api/redaction-rules`: List all redaction rules.
- `DELETE /api/redaction-rules/{id}`: Delete a redaction rule.

## 5. Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Automatic redaction of PII in logs is implemented and functional.
- [ ] Log redaction adds no more than a 10% overhead to log processing time.
- [ ] Customizable redaction rules can be created, listed, and deleted via new API endpoints.
- [ ] An audit trail of redaction actions is maintained, with appropriate metadata.
- [ ] Documentation is updated with clear, comprehensive details on the redaction process and API usage.
- [ ] All new code is covered by unit and integration tests with >95% coverage.
- [ ] Performance, reliability, and security non-functional requirements are met.

## 6. Dependencies and Prerequisites

- Access to the existing MeshHook codebase and infrastructure.
- Supabase and Postgres setup for development and testing.
- Knowledge of the current logging and data storage mechanisms.

## 7. Implementation Notes

### 7.1 Development Guidelines

- Follow the existing code style and conventions.
- Write modular, reusable code with comprehensive inline documentation.
- Ensure all new functionality is covered by automated tests.

### 7.2 Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests:** For redaction logic and rule application.
- **Integration Tests:** For the full log processing pipeline, including redaction and audit logging.
- **Performance Tests:** To verify the impact on log processing times.

### 7.3 Security Considerations

- Ensure redacted logs cannot be reverse-engineered to expose PII.
- Securely manage and access redaction rules and audit logs.

### 7.4 Monitoring & Observability

- Implement monitoring to track the performance impact of log redaction.
- Alerting for failures in the log redaction process or violations of performance thresholds.
