# PRD: Query Optimization for MeshHook Workflow Engine

## Overview

The MeshHook project, a webhook-first, deterministic, Postgres-native workflow engine, is entering Phase 10: Polish & Launch, with an emphasis on optimizing database queries to enhance the overall performance and efficiency of the system. This endeavor is pivotal for maintaining MeshHook's commitment to delivering high-performing, scalable, and reliable workflow automation solutions. By focusing on optimizing critical database operations, we aim to ensure that MeshHook can handle increased volumes of data and more complex workflows while maintaining sub-second response times and a seamless user experience.

### Purpose

- **Optimize Database Queries:** Target the improvement of execution times for database operations, prioritizing those impacting user-facing functionalities and overall system performance.
- **Ensure System Responsiveness:** Uphold MeshHook's promise of delivering a high-performance experience with sub-second response times across its functionalities.
- **Boost System Scalability and Reliability:** Enhance MeshHook's ability to manage larger datasets and more intricate workflows through optimized queries, thereby supporting greater scalability and reliability.

## Functional Requirements

1. **Identify Performance Bottlenecks:** Use Supabase performance analysis tools to pinpoint slow or inefficient database queries that are critical to the system's performance.
2. **Develop Optimization Strategies:** For each identified bottleneck, create a comprehensive optimization plan that may include the creation or alteration of indexes, restructuring of queries, and consideration of data denormalization for performance gains.
3. **Implement Optimizations:** Execute the planned optimizations, ensuring they do not conflict with existing functionalities or compromise data integrity.
4. **Benchmark Performance Improvements:** Establish performance benchmarks and conduct comparative analyses to measure the impact of the optimizations on query execution times.
5. **Update Documentation:** Revise technical documentation to reflect the changes made, including modifications to query structures, new or altered indexes, and the reasoning behind specific optimizations.

## Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** Achieve significant improvements in query execution times while ensuring response times for user interactions are maintained or reduced, ideally within sub-second durations.
- **Reliability:** Guarantee that the optimized queries do not introduce new failure modes, maintaining or enhancing the system's existing reliability.
- **Security:** Ensure all optimizations are compliant with MeshHook's security standards, safeguarding data integrity and privacy.
- **Maintainability:** Enhance or maintain the readability and maintainability of the SQL queries and associated application code, adhering to MeshHook's coding practices.

## Technical Specifications

### Architecture Context

MeshHook leverages Supabase, including its Postgres database, for backend services. The query optimizations will primarily focus on refining SQL queries within this database environment, considering how these adjustments impact the overall performance of the workflow engine, particularly in areas such as webhook processing, workflow execution, and live log streaming.

#### Integration Points

- **Database Schema:** Modifications will be made directly to SQL queries and indexing strategies without altering the existing database schema's integrity.
- **Workflow Engine:** Adjustments may be required in how the engine processes and retrieves data to accommodate the optimized queries efficiently.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Performance Analysis:** Utilize Supabase tooling to identify and analyze slow-performing or inefficient queries.
2. **Optimization Strategy Development:** Craft specific optimization strategies for each bottleneck, including:
   - Index optimization or creation.
   - Query refactoring for efficiency.
   - Consideration of denormalization for frequently accessed data.
3. **Optimization Implementation and Testing:** Apply the optimization strategies and conduct thorough testing to ensure functionality remains intact with no regression.
4. **Benchmarking and Monitoring:** Perform detailed benchmarking against set performance metrics to validate improvements. Continue monitoring the system's performance to ensure ongoing efficiency and reliability.

### Data Model Changes

- **Indexes:** Introduction or modification of indexes on key tables to enhance query performance based on the analysis findings.
- **Schema Adjustments:** If necessary, minor schema adjustments to support optimized query patterns, ensuring they do not adversely affect data integrity.

### API Endpoints

- N/A. This task focuses on backend optimizations. Indirect improvements in API response times may result from these optimizations, but no new API endpoints will be introduced.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Performance bottlenecks identified and documented.
- [ ] Optimization strategies developed for each bottleneck and documented.
- [ ] Optimizations implemented with no loss of functionality or data integrity.
- [ ] Performance benchmarks show measurable improvement in query execution times.
- [ ] System reliability and responsiveness are maintained or improved post-optimization.
- [ ] Documentation updated to reflect optimization efforts and outcomes.

## Dependencies

- **Technical Dependencies:** Requires access to Supabase performance analysis tools and existing database and query implementations.
- **Knowledge/Tools:** Presumes familiarity with SQL, optimization strategies, indexing, and the specifics of working with a Postgres database.

## Implementation Notes

### Development Guidelines

- Prioritize optimizations that enhance readability and maintainability, adhering to SQL best practices and MeshHookâ€™s coding standards.
- Thoroughly document all changes, including the justification for specific optimizations and any considered trade-offs.

### Testing Strategy

- **Regression Testing:** Confirm that all existing functionalities operate as expected post-optimization.
- **Performance Testing:** Use benchmarks to quantify performance improvements, ensuring they meet or exceed set targets.

### Security Considerations

- Ensure optimizations do not compromise MeshHook's security model, especially in terms of data exposure or multi-tenant security.

### Monitoring & Observability

- Augment current system monitoring to capture the impact of query optimizations on performance and reliability.
- Adjust monitoring thresholds to align with the new performance standards post-optimization.

By adhering to this PRD, the MeshHook team will effectively enhance the system's performance, reinforcing its position as a robust, efficient, and scalable solution for complex workflow automation challenges.
