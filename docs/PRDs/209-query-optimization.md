# PRD: Query Optimization for MeshHook Workflow Engine

## Overview

This PRD outlines the approach for optimizing database queries within the MeshHook project, a webhook-first, deterministic, Postgres-native workflow engine. The aim is to enhance the performance and efficiency of MeshHook by identifying and improving slow or inefficient database operations. This task aligns with the project's objectives to maintain high performance, reliability, and scalability, essential for delivering n8n's visual simplicity and Temporal's durability without restrictive licensing.

### Purpose

- To ensure MeshHook's operations maintain sub-second response times by optimizing database queries.
- To improve the overall efficiency of data retrieval and manipulation, contributing to the system's scalability and reliability.

## Functional Requirements

1. **Query Identification:** Identify slow or inefficient queries through analysis tools and logs.
2. **Optimization Plan:** Develop a plan to optimize identified queries, considering indexing, query restructuring, and potential denormalization.
3. **Implementation:** Apply the optimization plan to the identified queries.
4. **Regression Testing:** Ensure that query optimizations do not adversely affect the functionality or data integrity of MeshHook.
5. **Performance Benchmarking:** Compare pre- and post-optimization query performance to quantify improvements.

## Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** Achieve a measurable improvement in the execution time for optimized queries, aiming for sub-second response times on user-facing operations.
- **Reliability:** Maintain or improve the current system’s reliability, ensuring optimized queries do not introduce new points of failure.
- **Security:** Ensure query optimizations adhere to MeshHook's security guidelines, including RLS and secrets management.
- **Maintainability:** Write clear, well-documented SQL for optimized queries, adhering to MeshHook’s coding standards.

## Technical Specifications

### Architecture Context

MeshHook leverages a combination of SvelteKit for the frontend and Supabase for backend services including Postgres for data storage and queue management, Realtime for live log streaming, and additional services for storage and edge functions.

#### Integration Points

- **Database Schema:** Optimization tasks will primarily involve changes to SQL queries and potentially the schema (e.g., adding indexes) within the Postgres database.
- **Workflow Engine:** Query optimizations may affect how the workflow engine retrieves and processes data, requiring coordination with the system's orchestrator and HTTP executor components.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Analysis:** Utilize Supabase's performance analysis tools and logs to identify queries that are slow or inefficient.
2. **Design Optimization Plan:** For each identified query, design an optimization strategy. This may involve:
   - Adding or modifying indexes.
   - Refactoring queries for efficiency.
   - Considering denormalization for frequently accessed data.
3. **Implement Optimizations:** Apply the optimization strategies to the database and related application code.
4. **Testing:** Perform regression and performance tests to ensure optimizations improve performance without affecting functionality.
5. **Monitoring:** Monitor the system post-implementation to ensure the optimizations perform as expected under real-world conditions.

### Data Model Changes

- Add necessary indexes to tables involved in slow queries, with specific attention to foreign keys and columns used in WHERE clauses.
- Update `schema.sql` with any schema changes and document the rationale for each change.

### API Endpoints

- No new API endpoints required for this task. Existing endpoints may experience performance improvements as a result of query optimization.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Identified slow or inefficient queries are optimized.
- [ ] Performance benchmarks show a measurable improvement in query execution times.
- [ ] Regression tests confirm that optimizations do not affect existing functionality.
- [ ] The system maintains or improves reliability metrics post-optimization.
- [ ] All changes are well-documented and adhere to MeshHook's coding and security standards.
- [ ] No adverse effects on system security or data integrity.

## Dependencies

- Access to Supabase's performance analysis tools.
- Comprehensive test suite to ensure functionality is maintained post-optimization.

## Implementation Notes

### Development Guidelines

- Employ Postgres best practices for query optimization.
- Document all changes to the database schema and queries.
- Follow MeshHook's coding standards for any application code changes.

### Testing Strategy

- Utilize existing unit and integration tests to ensure no regression.
- Develop performance tests to benchmark query improvements.

### Security Considerations

- Confirm that optimized queries and schema changes do not compromise RLS or other security mechanisms.
- Ensure that any changes follow MeshHook's security guidelines.

### Monitoring & Observability

- Monitor query performance post-implementation to ensure optimizations have the desired effect.
- Adjust monitoring thresholds as necessary to account for improved performance metrics.
