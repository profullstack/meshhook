# PRD: Query Optimization for MeshHook Workflow Engine

## Overview

<<<<<<< HEAD
This PRD targets the optimization of database queries within the MeshHook project, aiming to enhance performance and efficiency across the system. Given MeshHook's architecture—a webhook-first, deterministic, Postgres-native workflow engine—it's crucial that the system operates with optimal efficiency to handle high volumes of data and complex workflows, ensuring a smooth and responsive user experience. This task aligns with MeshHook's broader goals by directly contributing to the system’s performance, a core pillar of its value proposition alongside its features like visual DAG building, durable runs, and multi-tenant security.

- **Maintain system responsiveness:** Ensure MeshHook continues to deliver sub-second response times across its operations, particularly those involving data retrieval and processing.
- **Enhance system scalability and reliability:** By optimizing queries, MeshHook will be better equipped to handle larger datasets and more complex workflows without compromising on performance or reliability.

## Functional Requirements

1. **Performance Analysis:** Utilize Supabase performance analysis tools to identify slow or inefficient queries.
2. **Optimization Strategies:** Develop and document strategies for each identified query, considering indexing, query restructuring, and potential denormalization.
3. **Implementation of Optimizations:** Apply optimizations, ensuring compatibility with existing functionality and data integrity.
4. **Performance Benchmarking:** Establish benchmarks and compare pre- and post-optimization performance metrics.
5. **Documentation:** Update technical documentation to reflect changes in query structures, indexes added, and rationale behind optimizations.

## Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** Achieve a measurable improvement in query execution times, with a target of maintaining or reducing current response times, aiming for sub-second responses for user interactions.
- **Reliability:** Ensure the optimized queries do not introduce new failure modes and maintain the system’s high reliability standard.
- **Security:** Adhere to MeshHook’s existing security model, ensuring optimizations do not compromise data integrity or privacy.
- **Maintainability:** Maintain or improve the readability and maintainability of SQL queries and related application code, adhering to MeshHook’s coding standards.

## Technical Specifications

### Architecture Context

<<<<<<< HEAD
MeshHook utilizes Supabase for backend services, including Postgres for data storage. Query optimizations will primarily involve adjusting SQL queries within this database, considering the broader implications on the workflow engine's performance, especially in areas like webhook processing, workflow execution, and live logs streaming.

#### Integration Points

- **Database Schema:** Direct modifications to SQL queries and indexing strategies.
- **Workflow Engine:** Potential adjustments to data retrieval and processing patterns to accommodate optimized queries.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Performance Analysis:** Leverage Supabase tooling to pinpoint performance bottlenecks in database operations.
2. **Optimization Strategy Development:** For each identified bottleneck, develop a tailored optimization strategy. This may involve:
   - Index creation or modification.
   - Refactoring complex queries into simpler, more efficient forms.
   - Denormalization of frequently accessed data for faster reads.
3. **Implementation and Testing:** Apply the optimization strategies, followed by rigorous testing to ensure there are no regressions or functionality compromises.
4. **Performance Benchmarking and Monitoring:** Conduct thorough benchmarking against established performance metrics; monitor the system's performance post-optimization to ensure continued efficiency and reliability.

### Data Model Changes

- **Indexes:** Introduction of new indexes or modification of existing ones on critical pathways identified during the analysis phase.
- **Schema Adjustments:** Any necessary adjustments to the database schema to facilitate optimized query patterns must be documented and implemented carefully to avoid disrupting existing data integrity.

### API Endpoints

- N/A (This task focuses on backend query optimizations and does not directly introduce new API endpoints. However, improvements in query performance may indirectly enhance the responsiveness of existing endpoints.)

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Performance analysis completed, with slow or inefficient queries identified.
- [ ] Optimization strategies developed and documented for each identified query.
- [ ] Optimizations implemented, with no regressions in functionality or data integrity.
- [ ] Performance benchmarks demonstrate measurable improvement in query execution times.
- [ ] System's reliability and responsiveness maintained or improved post-optimization.
- [ ] All changes are thoroughly documented, following MeshHook’s coding and documentation standards.

## Dependencies

- **Technical Dependencies:** Access to Supabase performance analysis tools; existing database schema and query implementations.
- **Prerequisite Knowledge/Tools:** Familiarity with SQL optimization strategies, indexing, and the specific characteristics of the Postgres database.
=======
MeshHook leverages a combination of SvelteKit for the frontend and Supabase for backend services including Postgres for data storage and queue management, Realtime for live log streaming, and additional services for storage and edge functions.

#### Integration Points

- **Database Schema:** Optimization tasks will primarily involve changes to SQL queries and potentially the schema (e.g., adding indexes) within the Postgres database.
- **Workflow Engine:** Query optimizations may affect how the workflow engine retrieves and processes data, requiring coordination with the system's orchestrator and HTTP executor components.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Analysis:** Utilize Supabase's performance analysis tools and logs to identify queries that are slow or inefficient.
2. **Design Optimization Plan:** For each identified query, design an optimization strategy. This may involve:
   - Adding or modifying indexes.
   - Refactoring queries for efficiency.
   - Considering denormalization for frequently accessed data.
