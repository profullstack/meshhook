# PRD: Query Optimization for MeshHook

## Overview

This Product Requirements Document (PRD) outlines the requirements and approach for optimizing the database queries within the MeshHook project. The goal of this task is to enhance the performance, efficiency, and reliability of MeshHook by identifying and improving slow or inefficient database operations. This optimization effort is critical to ensuring that MeshHook meets its non-functional requirements of performance and reliability, especially as it scales to support more workflows and tenants. This task aligns with the project's goal of delivering a high-performance, webhook-first, deterministic, Postgres-native workflow engine.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

1. **Identify Inefficient Queries:** Use logging, monitoring tools, and query analysis to identify slow or inefficient queries within the MeshHook application.
2. **Optimize Queries:** Apply best practices in SQL performance optimization to refactor identified queries. This may include, but is not limited to, rewriting queries, adding necessary indexes, and avoiding full table scans.
3. **Pagination and Lazy Loading:** Where applicable, implement pagination or lazy loading to reduce the load on the database and improve response times.
4. **Caching Strategy:** Evaluate and implement caching strategies for frequently accessed data to reduce database load.
5. **Document Optimizations:** Clearly document the changes made for each optimization, including the rationale and the observed impact on performance.

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** Achieve a measurable improvement in database query performance, aiming for sub-second response times for user-facing operations.
- **Reliability:** Ensure that optimizations do not introduce regressions or compromise the integrity of data operations.
- **Maintainability:** Write clean, well-commented SQL and application code that follows project conventions and makes future optimizations easier.

## Technical Specifications

### Architecture Context

MeshHook uses Supabase, which includes Postgres for data storage and management. The optimization efforts should consider the following components:
- **Supabase Postgres:** Primary data store for workflows, runs, events, and secrets.
- **Supabase Realtime:** Used for live log streaming; optimization efforts should ensure that database changes do not disrupt this functionality.
- **Workers:** State machine and scheduling; consider the impact of query changes on worker operations.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Planning and Analysis:**
   - Review the existing system architecture and database schema to understand the data flow and query patterns.
   - Utilize Supabase's monitoring tools to identify slow or inefficient queries.
2. **Optimization:**
   - For each identified query, consider rewriting, indexing, and other PostgreSQL optimization techniques.
   - Implement and test pagination or lazy loading for large datasets.
   - Develop a caching strategy for frequently accessed data.
3. **Testing and Validation:**
   - Use unit and integration tests to validate query functionality and performance improvements.
   - Monitor the impact of changes in a staging environment before deploying to production.

### Data Model Changes

- Add indexes to columns frequently used in WHERE clauses or JOIN conditions.
- Evaluate the need for partial indexes or materialized views for complex aggregations.

### API Endpoints

No new API endpoints are required for this task. However, ensure that changes to the database layer do not affect the existing API contract.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Identified inefficient queries and implemented optimizations.
- [ ] Documented the rationale and performance improvements for each optimization.
- [ ] Ensured no regressions in functionality or data integrity.
- [ ] Achieved sub-second response times for optimized operations.
- [ ] All tests (unit and integration) pass.
- [ ] Monitoring in staging demonstrates improved performance without adverse effects.

## Dependencies and Prerequisites

- Access to Supabase project and monitoring tools.
- Familiarity with the current MeshHook database schema and query patterns.
- Existing testing framework and staging environment for validation.

## Implementation Notes

### Development Guidelines

- Follow SQL best practices for query optimization.
- Document all changes and their expected impact on performance.
- Ensure backward compatibility of the database schema.

### Testing Strategy

- Use existing unit and integration tests to ensure no regressions.
- Implement new tests if necessary to cover the optimizations.
- Monitor performance in a staging environment before production deployment.

### Security Considerations

- Ensure that optimizations do not introduce security vulnerabilities, such as SQL injection.
- Validate all inputs and use parameterized queries where applicable.

### Monitoring & Observability

- Enhance existing logging and monitoring to capture detailed metrics on query performance.
- Set up alerts for any performance regressions detected post-optimization.

This PRD outlines the approach to optimizing database queries within MeshHook to ensure improved performance, reliability, and maintainability, aligning with the project's core objectives and technical architecture.
