# PRD: Save/Load Workflow Definitions

**Issue:** [#125](https://github.com/profullstack/meshhook/issues/125)  
**Milestone:** Phase 3: Frontend (SvelteKit)  
**Labels:** workflow-builder  
**Phase:** Phase 3  
**Section:** Workflow Builder

---

## Overview

The save/load workflow definitions feature is a critical component of the MeshHook project, enabling users to persist their workflow configurations and retrieve them for future editing or execution. This capability ensures that complex workflows can be developed incrementally, shared among team members, and maintained over time. It aligns with MeshHook’s goals of providing a durable, visually intuitive, and secure workflow engine.

## Functional Requirements

1. **Save Workflows:** Users must be able to save their current workflow definitions, including all nodes, connections, and configuration settings.
2. **Load Workflows:** Users must be able to load previously saved workflow definitions into the visual DAG builder for editing or execution.
3. **Versioning:** Each save operation should create a new version of the workflow definition to support rollback and history tracking.
4. **UI Integration:** The save and load functionalities should be seamlessly integrated into the existing DAG builder UI.
5. **Multi-Tenant Support:** Ensure that workflow definitions are saved and loaded in a tenant-specific manner, adhering to RLS policies.

## Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** Workflow save and load operations should complete within 500ms to ensure a responsive user experience.
- **Security:** All saved workflow definitions must be stored securely, with sensitive information encrypted and access controlled via RLS.
- **Reliability:** The save and load feature should have an uptime of 99.9%, with proper error handling and recovery mechanisms in place.

## Technical Specifications

### Architecture Context

MeshHook utilizes a microservices architecture with the frontend powered by SvelteKit for SSR/API interactions, and backend components including Supabase for database and real-time updates, and dedicated workers for orchestration and execution.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Extend Data Model:** Add a new table `workflow_definitions` with fields for storing serialized workflow configurations, versions, and tenant IDs.
2. **API Endpoints:**
   - `POST /api/workflows`: Save a new workflow definition or update an existing one.
   - `GET /api/workflows/{id}`: Retrieve a specific workflow definition by ID.
   - Ensure endpoints enforce multi-tenancy rules and are secured according to project standards.
3. **UI Updates:** Modify the SvelteKit frontend to include "Save" and "Load" buttons in the workflow builder interface, with appropriate dialogs for naming and selecting workflows.
4. **Integration Testing:** Ensure the feature integrates properly with existing components, particularly the visual DAG builder and the backend API.
5. **Error Handling:** Implement comprehensive error handling for API endpoints and UI interactions, including user-friendly error messages for common issues.

### Data Model

- **Workflow Definitions Table:**  
  - `id` (UUID): Primary Key  
  - `project_id` (UUID): Foreign Key to `projects` table  
  - `name` (TEXT): Workflow name  
  - `definition` (JSONB): Serialized workflow configuration  
  - `version` (INT): Workflow version  
  - `created_at` (TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE)  
  - `updated_at` (TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE)

### API Endpoints

- **Save Workflow Definition:**  
  - `POST /api/workflows`  
  - Body: `{ name: string, definition: object, projectId: string }`  
- **Load Workflow Definition:**  
  - `GET /api/workflows/{id}`

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Workflow definitions can be saved and associated with a specific tenant and user.
- [ ] Users can load saved workflow definitions for editing or execution.
- [ ] Workflow versioning is implemented, allowing users to track changes over time.
- [ ] The UI provides a seamless experience for saving and loading workflows.
- [ ] API endpoints for saving and loading workflows are secured and performant.
- [ ] Integration with existing components (DAG builder, backend services) is verified through tests.
- [ ] Documentation is updated to include new endpoints and data model changes.

## Dependencies

- SvelteKit for frontend changes.
- Supabase for backend storage and real-time updates.
- Existing authentication and multi-tenancy mechanisms.

## Implementation Notes

### Development Guidelines

- Follow existing coding standards and patterns for SvelteKit and Supabase interactions.
- Ensure new features are fully type-checked and comply with ESLint and Prettier configurations.
- Write unit and integration tests covering new functionality.

### Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests:** For API logic and utility functions.
- **Integration Tests:** For API endpoints and their interaction with the database.
- **E2E Tests:** For the save/load workflow user journey.

### Security Considerations

- Ensure all API interactions are authenticated and authorized according to the project’s RLS policy.
- Encrypt sensitive parts of the workflow definition as necessary.

### Monitoring & Observability

- Instrument new API endpoints with logging and metrics collection to monitor usage patterns and performance bottlenecks.
- Set up alerts for any errors or performance issues detected in the save/load workflow functionalities.
