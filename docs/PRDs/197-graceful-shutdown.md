# PRD: Graceful Shutdown

## Overview

<<<<<<< HEAD
The graceful shutdown feature is a critical component in ensuring the MeshHook workflow engine maintains its reliability, performance, and data integrity during shutdown processes, whether they are planned or unplanned. This feature ensures that ongoing processes are allowed to complete and resources are properly released without causing disruptions or data loss. Implementing a graceful shutdown process aligns with MeshHook's objectives to provide a robust, durable, and reliable workflow engine.

### Purpose

The purpose of this task is to implement a graceful shutdown mechanism that minimizes the risk of data corruption, loss, and service disruption during the shutdown of MeshHook services. This feature is essential for maintaining high availability, data integrity, and a seamless operational experience.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

1. **Graceful Termination of Services:** Ensure all running services and subprocesses can terminate gracefully upon receiving a shutdown signal.
2. **Completion of Ongoing Tasks:** Allow currently processing workflows to complete before the shutdown process proceeds.
3. **Resource Cleanup:** Ensure the release of all resources, including database connections, file handles, and network connections, before shutdown.
4. **Shutdown Hooks:** Implement shutdown hooks to trigger the graceful shutdown process.
5. **Timeout Management:** Introduce configurable timeouts for shutdown processes, ensuring that hang processes do not indefinitely delay the shutdown.
6. **Logging:** Maintain detailed logs of the shutdown process, including the completion of tasks and any issues encountered.

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** Ensure the graceful shutdown process does not significantly impact the system's performance or responsiveness.
- **Reliability:** Achieve 99.9% reliability in shutting down and restarting services without data loss or corruption.
- **Security:** Maintain all security protocols during the shutdown process.
- **Maintainability:** Implement the graceful shutdown feature in a way that is maintainable and easily understood by other developers.
=======
As part of Phase 9: Deployment & Operations, this task focuses on implementing a graceful shutdown mechanism for the MeshHook workflow engine. Graceful shutdown is crucial for maintaining data integrity and ensuring no in-flight workflows are abruptly terminated, thereby aligning with MeshHook's commitment to reliability and durability. This task directly supports the project's goals by enhancing the operational robustness of the system, particularly in scenarios requiring service restarts or deployments.

## Functional Requirements

1. **Shutdown Initiation**: The system must detect and initiate a graceful shutdown sequence upon receiving termination signals (e.g., SIGINT, SIGTERM).
2. **In-flight Workflow Completion**: Allow currently processing workflows to complete execution without starting new ones.
3. **Queue Draining**: Ensure that all queued tasks are either completed or safely persisted for later processing.
4. **Connections Closure**: Close all database and external API connections gracefully after ensuring all transactions are complete.
5. **Timeout for Shutdown**: Implement a configurable timeout for the graceful shutdown process, after which a forced shutdown may occur.
6. **Shutdown Hooks**: Provide hooks or callbacks for custom cleanup tasks during the shutdown process.

## Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance**: The shutdown process must not significantly impact the system's performance, ensuring that in-flight workflows complete within their expected time frames.
- **Reliability**: Achieve a graceful shutdown in over 99.9% of termination scenarios, with proper handling of edge cases.
- **Security**: Maintain all security protocols during shutdown, ensuring no data leaks or breaches occur.
- **Maintainability**: Implement the graceful shutdown feature in a way that is maintainable and easily understood by other developers.

## Technical Specifications

### Architecture Context

<<<<<<< HEAD
MeshHook utilizes a microservices architecture, with components orchestrated via Supabase, including Postgres for data storage and queues, and SvelteKit for the frontend. The graceful shutdown feature must integrate seamlessly across these components, ensuring a cohesive shutdown process.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Analysis:** Review the current architecture and identify components requiring graceful shutdown procedures.
2. **Design:** Develop a strategy for each component (SvelteKit-based services, Supabase/Postgres connections, Worker processes) to gracefully handle shutdown signals.
   - For SvelteKit services, leverage lifecycle hooks for shutdown processes.
   - For Postgres connections, ensure proper disconnection logic.
   - For Worker processes, implement signal listeners to manage active jobs and resource cleanup.
3. **Implementation:** Develop the graceful shutdown feature based on the design, focusing on modularity and reuse across components.
4. **Integration:** Test the integration with existing components to ensure compatibility and non-disruption.
5. **Testing:** Perform rigorous testing, including unit, integration, and end-to-end tests, to ensure the feature meets all requirements.
6. **Documentation:** Update the system documentation to include details about the graceful shutdown process and configuration options.
7. **Review:** Conduct a thorough code review and testing session with the team to ensure quality and adherence to project standards.

### Data Model Changes

No changes to the data model are required for this task.
=======
MeshHook utilizes SvelteKit for its SSR/API layer, Supabase for its backend services, and a combination of Orchestrator and HTTP Executor workers. The graceful shutdown mechanism must integrate seamlessly across these components, particularly focusing on the Workers and Supabase (Postgres, Realtime).

### Implementation Approach

1. **Analysis**: Review the signal handling capabilities of Node.js and SvelteKit, along with Supabase client and worker management practices.
   
2. **Design**:
   - Define a signal listener at the entry point of the application that triggers the shutdown sequence.
   - Design a workflow state checkpoint system in Postgres to mark the progress of in-flight workflows.
   - Outline a strategy for closing Supabase connections and handling queued tasks.

3. **Implementation**:
   - Implement the signal listener for graceful shutdown initiation.
   - Develop the logic for completing in-flight workflows and persisting their states.
   - Ensure all external connections are closed gracefully, following any ongoing transactions or processes.

4. **Integration**:
   - Integrate the graceful shutdown mechanism with existing components, ensuring minimal disruption.
   - Test the shutdown process in development environments to ensure compatibility.

5. **Testing**:
   - Conduct thorough testing, including unit, integration, and end-to-end tests, to validate the graceful shutdown process under various scenarios.

6. **Documentation**:
   - Update the system documentation to include details on the graceful shutdown process and configuration options.
