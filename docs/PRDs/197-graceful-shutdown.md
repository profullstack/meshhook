# PRD: Graceful Shutdown

## Overview

As part of Phase 9: Deployment & Operations, this task focuses on implementing a graceful shutdown mechanism for the MeshHook workflow engine. Graceful shutdown is crucial for maintaining data integrity and ensuring no in-flight workflows are abruptly terminated, thereby aligning with MeshHook's commitment to reliability and durability. This task directly supports the project's goals by enhancing the operational robustness of the system, particularly in scenarios requiring service restarts or deployments.

## Functional Requirements

1. **Shutdown Initiation**: The system must detect and initiate a graceful shutdown sequence upon receiving termination signals (e.g., SIGINT, SIGTERM).
2. **In-flight Workflow Completion**: Allow currently processing workflows to complete execution without starting new ones.
3. **Queue Draining**: Ensure that all queued tasks are either completed or safely persisted for later processing.
4. **Connections Closure**: Close all database and external API connections gracefully after ensuring all transactions are complete.
5. **Timeout for Shutdown**: Implement a configurable timeout for the graceful shutdown process, after which a forced shutdown may occur.
6. **Shutdown Hooks**: Provide hooks or callbacks for custom cleanup tasks during the shutdown process.

## Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance**: The shutdown process must not significantly impact the system's performance, ensuring that in-flight workflows complete within their expected time frames.
- **Reliability**: Achieve a graceful shutdown in over 99.9% of termination scenarios, with proper handling of edge cases.
- **Security**: Maintain all security protocols during shutdown, ensuring no data leaks or breaches occur.
- **Maintainability**: Implement the graceful shutdown feature in a way that is maintainable and easily understood by other developers.

## Technical Specifications

### Architecture Context

MeshHook utilizes SvelteKit for its SSR/API layer, Supabase for its backend services, and a combination of Orchestrator and HTTP Executor workers. The graceful shutdown mechanism must integrate seamlessly across these components, particularly focusing on the Workers and Supabase (Postgres, Realtime).

### Implementation Approach

1. **Analysis**: Review the signal handling capabilities of Node.js and SvelteKit, along with Supabase client and worker management practices.
   
2. **Design**:
   - Define a signal listener at the entry point of the application that triggers the shutdown sequence.
   - Design a workflow state checkpoint system in Postgres to mark the progress of in-flight workflows.
   - Outline a strategy for closing Supabase connections and handling queued tasks.

3. **Implementation**:
   - Implement the signal listener for graceful shutdown initiation.
   - Develop the logic for completing in-flight workflows and persisting their states.
   - Ensure all external connections are closed gracefully, following any ongoing transactions or processes.

4. **Integration**:
   - Integrate the graceful shutdown mechanism with existing components, ensuring minimal disruption.
   - Test the shutdown process in development environments to ensure compatibility.

5. **Testing**:
   - Conduct thorough testing, including unit, integration, and end-to-end tests, to validate the graceful shutdown process under various scenarios.

6. **Documentation**:
   - Update the system documentation to include details on the graceful shutdown process and configuration options.

### Data Model

No direct changes to the data model are anticipated for this task. However, adjustments to the workflow state management tables may be necessary to ensure workflows can be accurately resumed after a shutdown.

### API Endpoints

No new API endpoints are required for this task.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Graceful shutdown process initiates upon receiving termination signals.
- [ ] In-flight workflows are allowed to complete, and their states are correctly persisted.
- [ ] All queued tasks are either completed or safely persisted for later processing.
- [ ] All database and external API connections are closed gracefully.
- [ ] The system can recover and resume operations smoothly after a shutdown.
- [ ] Documentation is updated to reflect the new graceful shutdown process and configuration.

## Dependencies

### Technical Dependencies

- Node.js and SvelteKit for signal handling.
- Supabase services for backend operations.
- Existing workflow and queue management mechanisms.

### Prerequisite Tasks

- Ensure all workers and services have proper error handling and state management.
- Verify current database schema supports efficient state persistence and recovery.

## Implementation Notes

### Development Guidelines

- Follow the existing coding standards and best practices for the project.
- Implement comprehensive error handling to cover failure scenarios during shutdown.
- Write tests covering various shutdown scenarios before implementing the functionality.

### Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests**: Focus on individual components' ability to handle shutdown signals and perform cleanup tasks.
- **Integration Tests**: Test the interaction between components during the shutdown process, including state persistence and connection closures.
- **E2E Tests**: Simulate real-world shutdown scenarios to ensure the system can recover without data loss or corruption.

### Security Considerations

- Ensure that all data handling during the shutdown process complies with MeshHook's security guidelines, including RLS and data encryption.

### Monitoring & Observability

- Implement logging around the shutdown process to monitor its effectiveness and identify potential issues.
- Monitor key metrics such as shutdown duration, in-flight workflow completion rates, and recovery times post-shutdown.
