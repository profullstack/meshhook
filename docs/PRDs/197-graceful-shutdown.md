# PRD: Graceful Shutdown Implementation for MeshHook

## Overview and Objectives

The implementation of a graceful shutdown mechanism for MeshHook is a strategic enhancement aimed at bolstering the platform's reliability, performance, and data integrity during the shutdown processes. This feature is pivotal for ensuring that ongoing workflows are allowed to complete and that resources are cleanly released, thereby minimizing the risk of service disruption or data loss. This aligns with MeshHook's overarching goals to deliver a robust, durable, and highly reliable workflow engine that meets the needs of diverse users, from indie builders to regulated operations teams.

### Purpose

This PRD outlines the approach for integrating a graceful shutdown process into MeshHook, ensuring that the system can handle planned or unplanned shutdowns without data corruption or loss, and without negatively impacting user experience.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

1. **Graceful Service Termination:** Implement mechanisms to gracefully terminate MeshHook services and subprocesses upon receiving a shutdown signal.
2. **Workflow Completion:** Ensure workflows currently being processed are completed before the service fully shuts down.
3. **Resource Management:** Guarantee the proper release and cleanup of all system resources, including database connections, file handles, and network connections.
4. **Shutdown Initiation:** Develop hooks or listeners for initiating the graceful shutdown process.
5. **Timeout Configuration:** Introduce system configurations for managing shutdown timeouts to prevent indefinite hanging during shutdown.
6. **Shutdown Logging:** Maintain comprehensive logs detailing the shutdown process, including tasks completed and any errors encountered.

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** The shutdown process must not degrade the system's performance or user experience.
- **Reliability:** Achieve a high reliability rate (99.9%) for graceful shutdowns, ensuring system restarts without data loss.
- **Security:** Ensure all existing security measures are upheld throughout the shutdown process.
- **Maintainability:** Code for the graceful shutdown feature should be easily maintainable and understandable.

## Technical Specifications

### Architecture Context

MeshHook operates on a microservices architecture, utilizing Supabase for orchestration, Postgres for data persistence, and SvelteKit for the frontend UI. The graceful shutdown mechanism must be seamlessly integrated across these components, ensuring a unified and cohesive process.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Analysis:** Conduct a comprehensive review of MeshHook's existing architecture to identify components that require integration with the graceful shutdown feature.
2. **Design:**
   - For **SvelteKit services**, utilize lifecycle hooks to manage graceful shutdowns.
   - For **Supabase/Postgres connections**, ensure proper disconnection and cleanup logic is implemented.
   - For **Worker processes**, create signal handlers that manage ongoing jobs and facilitate resource cleanup.
3. **Implementation:** Based on the design, develop the graceful shutdown feature with a focus on modularity to facilitate reuse across different components.
4. **Integration:** Ensure smooth integration with existing components, verifying that the shutdown process does not introduce disruptions.
5. **Testing:** Conduct exhaustive testing, including unit, integration, and end-to-end tests, to ensure the shutdown process meets all functional and non-functional requirements.
6. **Documentation:** Update project documentation to include detailed information on the graceful shutdown process and configuration.
7. **Review:** Perform a comprehensive code and feature review to guarantee adherence to MeshHook's quality standards.

### Data Model Changes

No data model changes are required for the implementation of this feature.

### API Endpoints

No new API endpoints will be introduced as part of this feature.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Services successfully terminate gracefully upon a shutdown signal.
- [ ] All ongoing workflows are completed before the shutdown finalizes.
- [ ] All system resources are properly released, with no resource leaks post-shutdown.
- [ ] The system demonstrates the ability to recover and restart without any data loss or corruption.
- [ ] Updated documentation accurately reflects the graceful shutdown process.
- [ ] All relevant tests (unit, integration, end-to-end) are passed successfully.

## Dependencies

### Technical Dependencies

- Access to MeshHook's current components and services.
- Development and testing environments configured for feature development.

### Prerequisite Tasks

- Ensure comprehensive access to all necessary services, components, and environments.

## Implementation Notes

### Development Guidelines

- Follow existing coding standards and best practices within the MeshHook project.
- Aim for modular, reusable code structures where feasible.
- Ensure new code is well-documented and straightforward for future maintainers.

### Testing Strategy

- Develop unit tests for newly introduced functions and methods.
- Integrate tests to verify the shutdown process works as intended without adversely affecting existing functionalities.
- Conduct stress tests to evaluate system behavior under load during the shutdown process.

### Security Considerations

- Maintain all current security protocols throughout the implementation and execution of the graceful shutdown process.
- Ensure no new vulnerabilities are introduced.

### Monitoring & Observability

- Enhance existing monitoring systems to include visibility into the graceful shutdown process, highlighting any failures or timeouts.
- Establish alerts for critical failures to ensure swift responses.
