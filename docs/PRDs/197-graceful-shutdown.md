# PRD: Graceful Shutdown

## Overview

The graceful shutdown feature is a critical component in ensuring the MeshHook workflow engine maintains its reliability, performance, and data integrity during shutdown processes, whether they are planned or unplanned. This feature ensures that ongoing processes are allowed to complete and resources are properly released without causing disruptions or data loss. Implementing a graceful shutdown process aligns with MeshHook's objectives to provide a robust, durable, and reliable workflow engine.

### Purpose

The purpose of this task is to implement a graceful shutdown mechanism that minimizes the risk of data corruption, loss, and service disruption during the shutdown of MeshHook services. This feature is essential for maintaining high availability, data integrity, and a seamless operational experience.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

1. **Graceful Termination of Services:** Ensure all running services and subprocesses can terminate gracefully upon receiving a shutdown signal.
2. **Completion of Ongoing Tasks:** Allow currently processing workflows to complete before the shutdown process proceeds.
3. **Resource Cleanup:** Ensure the release of all resources, including database connections, file handles, and network connections, before shutdown.
4. **Shutdown Hooks:** Implement shutdown hooks to trigger the graceful shutdown process.
5. **Timeout Management:** Introduce configurable timeouts for shutdown processes, ensuring that hang processes do not indefinitely delay the shutdown.
6. **Logging:** Maintain detailed logs of the shutdown process, including the completion of tasks and any issues encountered.

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** Ensure the graceful shutdown process does not significantly impact the system's performance or responsiveness.
- **Reliability:** Achieve 99.9% reliability in shutting down and restarting services without data loss or corruption.
- **Security:** Maintain all security protocols during the shutdown process.
- **Maintainability:** Implement the graceful shutdown feature in a way that is maintainable and easily understood by other developers.

## Technical Specifications

### Architecture Context

MeshHook utilizes a microservices architecture, with components orchestrated via Supabase, including Postgres for data storage and queues, and SvelteKit for the frontend. The graceful shutdown feature must integrate seamlessly across these components, ensuring a cohesive shutdown process.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Analysis:** Review the current architecture and identify components requiring graceful shutdown procedures.
2. **Design:** Develop a strategy for each component (SvelteKit-based services, Supabase/Postgres connections, Worker processes) to gracefully handle shutdown signals.
   - For SvelteKit services, leverage lifecycle hooks for shutdown processes.
   - For Postgres connections, ensure proper disconnection logic.
   - For Worker processes, implement signal listeners to manage active jobs and resource cleanup.
3. **Implementation:** Develop the graceful shutdown feature based on the design, focusing on modularity and reuse across components.
4. **Integration:** Test the integration with existing components to ensure compatibility and non-disruption.
5. **Testing:** Perform rigorous testing, including unit, integration, and end-to-end tests, to ensure the feature meets all requirements.
6. **Documentation:** Update the system documentation to include details about the graceful shutdown process and configuration options.
7. **Review:** Conduct a thorough code review and testing session with the team to ensure quality and adherence to project standards.

### Data Model Changes

No changes to the data model are required for this task.

### API Endpoints

No new API endpoints are required for this task.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Services can terminate gracefully upon receiving a shutdown signal.
- [ ] All ongoing tasks are allowed to complete before services shut down.
- [ ] Resources are properly released, and no leaks are detected post-shutdown.
- [ ] The system can recover and restart without data loss or corruption.
- [ ] Documentation is updated to reflect the graceful shutdown process.
- [ ] All tests (unit, integration, e2e) pass successfully.

## Dependencies

### Technical Dependencies

- Existing MeshHook components and services.
- Development and testing environments.

### Prerequisite Tasks

- Ensure access to all necessary services and environments.

## Implementation Notes

### Development Guidelines

- Adhere to the existing coding standards and best practices.
- Write modular, reusable code where possible.
- Ensure code is well-documented and easy to understand.

### Testing Strategy

- Implement unit tests for new functions and methods.
- Integrate tests to ensure the shutdown process does not negatively impact existing functionalities.
- Perform stress testing to evaluate the system's behavior under load during shutdown.

### Security Considerations

- Maintain all existing security measures and ensure that the shutdown process does not introduce vulnerabilities.

### Monitoring & Observability

- Enhance monitoring to track the graceful shutdown process, including any failures or timeouts.
- Set up alerts for failure scenarios to ensure immediate response.
