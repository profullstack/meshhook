# PRD: Create/Edit Workflow

**Issue:** [#127](https://github.com/profullstack/meshhook/issues/127)  
**Milestone:** Phase 3: Frontend (SvelteKit)  
**Labels:** workflow-management, hacktoberfest  
**Phase:** Phase 3  
**Section:** Workflow Management  

---

## Overview

The "Create/Edit Workflow" feature is a cornerstone of the MeshHook project, enabling users to define and modify their workflow processes visually. This feature leverages MeshHook's core capabilities, such as webhook triggers with signature verification and a visual DAG builder, to provide a user-friendly interface for constructing complex, deterministic workflows. This task aligns with MeshHook's goals of combining the simplicity of visual workflow construction with the robustness of event sourcing and multi-tenant security.

## Functional Requirements

1. **Visual Workflow Construction:**
   - Users must be able to create new workflows using a visual DAG builder.
   - The workflow editor must support editing existing workflows.
   - Users should be able to define webhook triggers, nodes (e.g., `transform`, `http_call`, `branch`, `delay`, `terminate`), and connections in the DAG.

2. **Workflow Configuration:**
   - Support configuration of webhook triggers including signature verification methods.
   - Allow users to configure node settings using JSON Schema-driven forms.
   - Enable versioning control, allowing users to save drafts and publish immutable workflow versions.

3. **Integration with Existing Systems:**
   - Ensure the workflow creation/editing process integrates smoothly with the backend for persistence.
   - Utilize Supabase Realtime for live updates during workflow configuration.

4. **User Experience:**
   - Provide a "Test run" feature that allows users to execute the workflow with a sample payload and view the execution path and results.
   - Implement a "resume from step" feature for debugging and testing workflows.

5. **Documentation and Best Practices:**
   - Document all user-facing features and configurations.
   - Follow MeshHook coding standards and project conventions throughout development.

## Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** The workflow editor must load and respond to user input without perceptible delay, maintaining a responsive user experience.
- **Reliability:** Changes to workflows must be saved reliably, with appropriate feedback provided to users on success or failure.
- **Security:** Adhere to MeshHook's security guidelines, especially regarding multi-tenancy and secrets management.
- **Maintainability:** Code should be clean, well-documented, and easy to maintain, with a clear separation of concerns and modular architecture.

## Technical Specifications

### Architecture Context

- Utilize SvelteKit for building the frontend workflow editor, ensuring integration with the existing SvelteKit/Svelte 5 based architecture.
- The frontend must communicate with the backend via RESTful APIs or GraphQL for fetching, saving, and publishing workflows.
- Supabase Realtime to be used for providing live feedback and updates in the editor.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Analysis:**
   - Review existing frontend and backend codebases to understand current implementation and integration points.
   
2. **Design:**
   - Define the UI/UX for the create/edit workflow interface, focusing on simplicity and usability.
   - Outline the frontend-backend interaction model, including API requests and real-time updates.
   
3. **Implementation:**
   - Develop the frontend interface using SvelteKit, incorporating the visual DAG builder and configuration forms.
   - Implement API calls for fetching, saving, and publishing workflows.
   - Integrate real-time feedback for the editing process using Supabase Realtime.
   
4. **Testing:**
   - Write unit and integration tests covering new features and interactions.
   - Conduct manual testing to ensure the feature meets user experience expectations.

5. **Deployment:**
   - Ensure the feature is fully integrated into the CI/CD pipeline for automated testing and deployment.

### Data Model

No immediate changes to the existing data model are required for this task. Should adjustments become necessary, they will be documented and included in the project's schema migrations.

### API Endpoints

- `GET /api/workflows/{id}`: Fetch a specific workflow for editing.
- `POST /api/workflows`: Create a new workflow.
- `PUT /api/workflows/{id}`: Update an existing workflow.
- `POST /api/workflows/{id}/publish`: Publish a workflow version.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Users can create new workflows using a visual interface.
- Users can edit existing workflows, with changes reflected in real-time.
- Workflows can be saved, with the ability to publish new versions.
- The workflow editor performs reliably under normal usage conditions.
- Security and multi-tenancy guidelines are adhered to throughout the implementation.
- The feature integrates seamlessly with the existing MeshHook architecture and patterns.

## Dependencies

- Access to the MeshHook codebase and development environment.
- Supabase project access for real-time updates and backend integration.

## Implementation Notes

### Development Guidelines

- Follow the existing project structure and coding conventions.
- Utilize TypeScript for type safety and better developer experience.
- Ensure code is well-commented, and document any new functions or modules.

### Testing Strategy

- Implement unit tests for new components and utility functions.
- Write integration tests to cover API interactions and real-time behavior.
- Perform manual testing for user experience verification.

### Security Considerations

- Ensure all user input is validated both client-side and server-side.
- Use existing project mechanisms for authentication and authorization.
- Follow secure coding practices to prevent common vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS, CSRF).

### Monitoring and Observability

- Integrate with existing logging and monitoring solutions to track usage and errors.
- Consider adding performance metrics specific to the workflow editor if necessary.
