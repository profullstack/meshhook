# PRD: Multi-tenant Isolation Tests

**Issue:** [#181](https://github.com/profullstack/meshhook/issues/181)  
**Milestone:** Phase 7: Testing  
**Labels:** integration-tests, hacktoberfest  
**Phase:** Phase 7  
**Section:** Integration Tests

## Overview

The objective of this task is to ensure that MeshHook's multi-tenant capabilities are robustly tested to prevent data leaks and ensure strict isolation between tenants. This is crucial for maintaining trust and security in a multi-tenant environment where multiple users or organizations use the same instance of MeshHook but must not have access to each other's data or workflows. The task aligns with MeshHook’s goal of providing secure, reliable, and efficient webhook-based workflow automation.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

1. **Isolation Verification:** Implement tests verifying that data across tenants (projects) cannot be accessed or modified outside of the prescribed tenant context.
2. **API Security Tests:** Ensure that all API endpoints honor multi-tenant security, rejecting unauthorized cross-tenant access attempts.
3. **Workflow Execution Isolation:** Verify that workflows executed in one tenant's context do not inadvertently impact or trigger workflows in another tenant's context.
4. **Secrets Security:** Test that secrets stored in the vault are only accessible within the tenant that created them.
5. **Audit Logs:** Ensure that audit logs accurately reflect the actions taken within each tenant, without exposing sensitive or cross-tenant information.

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** Ensure that the addition of multi-tenant isolation tests does not significantly impact the overall performance of the testing suite.
- **Reliability:** Tests should be deterministic, providing consistent results across runs.
- **Security:** Testing must not compromise the security of the MeshHook system or the data it holds.
- **Maintainability:** Tests should be designed for ease of maintenance and extension as new multi-tenant features are developed.

## Technical Specifications

### Architecture Context

MeshHook utilizes a combination of SvelteKit for front-end interactions, Supabase for backend services including Postgres for data storage, and a worker-based architecture for executing workflows. Multi-tenant security is enforced through Row-Level Security (RLS) policies in Postgres.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Analysis:** Review the current implementation of RLS and API authentication/authorization mechanisms.
2. **Test Design:** Develop a series of integration tests that:
   - Simulate multiple tenants interacting with the system.
   - Attempt cross-tenant data access and modifications.
   - Execute workflows in tenant-specific contexts.
3. **Tooling Selection:** Leverage existing test frameworks and possibly introduce new tools if required for effective multi-tenant testing.
4. **Test Development:** Implement the tests, integrating them into the existing CI/CD pipeline.
5. **Documentation:** Document the testing strategy, scenarios covered, and instructions for running the tests.

### Data Model

No changes to the data model are required specifically for this task. However, attention should be paid to the use of `project_id` for ensuring data isolation.

### API Endpoints

No new API endpoints are required for this task. Existing endpoints will be used in testing scenarios to verify multi-tenant isolation.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Integration tests covering multi-tenant isolation scenarios are implemented.
- [ ] Tests verify that cross-tenant access is not possible for data, workflows, and secrets.
- [ ] All new tests pass consistently in the CI/CD pipeline.
- [ ] Existing functionality remains unaffected, as verified by the existing test suite.
- [ ] Documentation is updated with the new testing scenarios and outcomes.

## Dependencies

- Access to the current MeshHook development environment.
- Existing integration testing framework and CI/CD setup.

## Implementation Notes

### Development Guidelines

- Tests should be written in a clear, understandable manner, following the existing coding and documentation standards.
- Use async/await patterns for handling asynchronous operations.
- Ensure that tests clean up after themselves to avoid polluting the test environment.

### Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests:** Not applicable for this task.
- **Integration Tests:** Focus of this task; to verify system behavior with a focus on multi-tenant isolation.
- **E2E Tests:** Leverage existing end-to-end tests to ensure overall system integrity.

### Security Considerations

- Ensure tests do not expose real data or secrets.
- Use mock data and tenants for testing purposes.
- Verify that RLS policies are correctly applied and cannot be bypassed.

### Monitoring & Observability

- Monitor test execution times and resource usage to identify any performance impact.
- Utilize logging within tests to help diagnose failures or unexpected behavior.
