# PRD: Multi-tenant Isolation Tests

**Issue:** [#181](https://github.com/profullstack/meshhook/issues/181)  
**Milestone:** Phase 7: Testing  
**Labels:** integration-tests, hacktoberfest  

## Overview

This PRD focuses on ensuring that MeshHook's multi-tenant architecture rigorously maintains data isolation across tenants to uphold security and privacy standards. The task is pivotal for safeguarding against data leaks and unauthorized data access across different tenants (organizations or users) utilizing MeshHook. This initiative is directly aligned with MeshHook's commitment to security and reliability, supporting its goal to provide a robust webhook-based workflow automation platform.

## Functional Requirements

1. **Tenant Data Isolation:** Integration tests must confirm that a tenant's data is inaccessible to and unaffected by other tenants.
2. **API Endpoint Security:** Tests should ensure all API endpoints properly enforce multi-tenant isolation, effectively rejecting requests that attempt cross-tenant access.
3. **Workflow Integrity:** It must be verified that a tenant's workflow execution remains isolated, having no impact on or visibility to another tenantâ€™s workflows.
4. **Secured Secrets Management:** Integration tests need to validate that secrets stored by a tenant are exclusively accessible to that tenant.
5. **Accurate Audit Trails:** Tests should affirm that audit logs correctly capture tenant-specific actions without exposing data or actions pertaining to other tenants.

## Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** The introduction of multi-tenant isolation tests should not degrade the performance of the overall test suite significantly.
- **Reliability:** Tests must produce consistent results, ensuring deterministic outcomes across repeated execution cycles.
- **Security:** The testing process must not expose or risk the integrity of stored data or the security posture of the MeshHook system.
- **Maintainability:** Designed for ease of update and extension, facilitating straightforward incorporation of future multi-tenant features and functionalities.

## Technical Specifications

### Architecture Context

MeshHook is built on a SvelteKit/Svelte 5 frontend, utilizing Supabase for backend services, including Postgres for persistent storage. Workflow execution is managed via a worker-based architecture. Multi-tenant security is implemented through Postgres Row-Level Security (RLS) policies to ensure data isolation.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Analysis:** Conduct a thorough review of the current implementation of multi-tenant architecture, focusing on RLS and API authentication/authorization mechanisms.
2. **Test Design:** Craft a suite of integration tests simulating various tenant interactions, cross-tenant access attempts, and tenant-specific workflow executions.
3. **Tooling Selection:** Evaluate and select appropriate testing frameworks or tools necessary for effectively executing multi-tenant integration tests.
4. **Test Development:** Develop and integrate the tests within the existing Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline, ensuring they run automatically as part of the testing phase.
5. **Documentation:** Update the project documentation to include descriptions of the new tests, their purposes, and detailed instructions for manual execution if necessary.

### Data Model

No direct changes to the data model are required for this task, but the focus will be on ensuring the `project_id` is correctly utilized to enforce data isolation across tenants.

### API Endpoints

Existing API endpoints will be leveraged to conduct the tests; no additional endpoints are required for this task. The emphasis will be on testing these endpoints for adherence to multi-tenant security protocols.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Integration tests for verifying multi-tenant isolation are successfully implemented and integrated into the CI/CD pipeline.
- [ ] Tests confirm that unauthorized cross-tenant data access is not possible for stored data, workflows, and secrets.
- [ ] All newly implemented tests consistently pass, confirming the integrity of multi-tenant isolation.
- [ ] The existing test suite passes without any regressions, ensuring that new tests have not adversely affected existing functionalities.
- [ ] Documentation is amended to include detailed descriptions of the new testing procedures and their objectives.

## Dependencies

- Access to the MeshHook development environment.
- Utilization of the existing integration testing framework and CI/CD infrastructure.

## Implementation Notes

### Development Guidelines

- Follow existing coding and documentation standards for test development.
- Implement asynchronous operations using the async/await pattern for clarity and performance.
- Design tests to be self-cleaning, ensuring they do not leave residual data that could affect subsequent tests.

### Testing Strategy

- **Integration Tests:** The primary focus, aimed at ensuring that system components correctly enforce multi-tenant isolation.
- **End-to-End (E2E) Tests:** Utilize existing E2E tests to verify the broader system integrity and the seamless integration of new tests.

### Security Considerations

- Implement tests with mock data to prevent exposing real tenant data.
- Ensure that RLS policies are rigorously tested to confirm they cannot be circumvented.

### Monitoring & Observability

- Monitor the execution time and resource consumption of the new tests to ensure they do not introduce significant performance overhead.
- Implement comprehensive logging within the tests to aid in diagnosing failures or unexpected behaviors.

By adhering to this PRD, MeshHook will enhance its multi-tenant architecture's security and reliability, ensuring robust isolation and integrity across tenants.
