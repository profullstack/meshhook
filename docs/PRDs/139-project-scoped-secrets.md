# PRD: Project-scoped secrets

**Issue:** [#139](https://github.com/profullstack/meshhook/issues/139)  
**Milestone:** Phase 3: Frontend (SvelteKit)  
**Labels:** secrets-management  
**Phase:** Phase 3  
**Section:** Secrets Management

---

## Overview

The objective of this task is to implement project-scoped secrets within the MeshHook platform. This functionality is critical for enabling secure storage and access to sensitive information, such as API keys and passwords, specific to each project. It aligns with MeshHook's goal of providing a secure, multi-tenant workflow engine by ensuring that secrets are isolated per project, enhancing overall security posture and compliance with data protection standards.

## Functional Requirements

1. **Secrets Creation and Storage:** Enable users to create and store secrets scoped to individual projects.
2. **Secrets Access and Retrieval:** Provide secure access and retrieval mechanisms for stored secrets during workflow execution, without exposing them in logs or UI.
3. **Secrets Deletion and Rotation:** Allow users to delete or rotate secrets, enforcing best practices in secrets management.
4. **UI Integration:** Integrate project-scoped secrets management in the MeshHook frontend, allowing users to manage secrets via the UI.
5. **API Support:** Ensure that project-scoped secrets can be managed programmatically via MeshHook's API.

## Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** Secret management operations should not significantly impact the platform's response times.
- **Security:** Implement industry-standard encryption for secrets storage and access controls to ensure that only authorized users and workflows can access secrets.
- **Reliability:** Secrets management feature should have a high availability, with proper fallback mechanisms in case of failures.
- **Maintainability:** The implementation should be easy to maintain and extend, following the project's code structure and patterns.

## Technical Specifications

### Architecture Context

- **Frontend:** SvelteKit will be used for the UI components related to secrets management.
- **Backend:** Supabase Postgres will store the secrets, encrypted at rest. Secrets are accessed via secure server-side functions that enforce project scoping.
- **Security:** AES-GCM encryption for secrets, with key encryption keys (KEKs) managed securely and rotated regularly.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Design UI and API Contracts:** Design the UI components and API contracts for managing project-scoped secrets.
2. **Implement Secrets Storage:** Extend the `schema.sql` to include a table for storing encrypted secrets with references to their respective projects.
3. **Develop Backend Logic:** Implement server-side logic for secrets management, including encryption/decryption, access control, and API endpoints.
4. **Integrate with Frontend:** Develop the frontend components for secrets management within the SvelteKit application.
5. **Testing and Documentation:** Write unit and integration tests covering the new functionality. Document the API endpoints and usage examples.

### Data Model Changes

- Add a new table `project_secrets`:
  - `id` (UUID): Primary key.
  - `project_id` (UUID): Foreign key to the `projects` table.
  - `name` (Text): The name of the secret.
  - `value` (Text): Encrypted value of the secret.
  - `created_at` (Timestamp): Creation timestamp.
  - `updated_at` (Timestamp): Last updated timestamp.

### API Endpoints

- **Create Secret:** `POST /api/projects/{projectId}/secrets`
- **Retrieve Secrets:** `GET /api/projects/{projectId}/secrets`
- **Delete Secret:** `DELETE /api/projects/{projectId}/secrets/{secretId}`

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Secrets can be created, retrieved, and deleted via both UI and API, scoped to projects.
- [ ] Secrets storage and retrieval operations are secure and do not expose sensitive information.
- [ ] Performance benchmarks are met, with minimal impact on response times.
- [ ] New functionality is fully covered by automated tests.
- [ ] Documentation for managing secrets is comprehensive and clear.
- [ ] Code changes are reviewed and meet project standards.

## Dependencies

### Technical Dependencies

- Supabase Postgres for data storage.
- Existing project infrastructure for deployment and testing.

### Prerequisite Tasks

- Ensure all related components and services are operational and accessible.

## Implementation Notes

### Development Guidelines

- Follow the existing project structure and coding patterns.
- Ensure code is modular, well-commented, and adheres to security best practices.

### Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests:** For backend logic and utility functions.
- **Integration Tests:** For API endpoints and UI components interaction.
- **Security Tests:** To verify encryption and access control measures.

### Security Considerations

- Use AES-GCM for encryption, with secure management of KEKs.
- Implement strict access controls and input validation for API endpoints.

### Monitoring and Observability

- Log operations related to secrets management, masking sensitive information.
- Monitor performance and error rates for secrets management features.
