# PRD: PII Detection Rules

**Issue:** [#148](https://github.com/profullstack/meshhook/issues/148)  
**Milestone:** Phase 4: Security  
**Labels:** pii-redaction, hacktoberfest  
**Project Context:** MeshHook - A webhook-first, deterministic, Postgres-native workflow engine

---

## 1. Overview

As MeshHook scales to handle more sensitive information across various workflows, the necessity of detecting and redacting Personally Identifiable Information (PII) has become paramount. This task aims to define and implement PII detection rules that can be applied to all data processed within the MeshHook system. By aligning with the project's security and multi-tenancy goals, this feature will enhance the platform's capability to protect user data, ensuring compliance with global data protection regulations.

### Purpose

To design and implement a set of rules and mechanisms for detecting PII within workflow data, enabling automatic redaction or encryption of sensitive information before storage or logging. This feature supports MeshHook's commitment to security, privacy, and reliability.

### Alignment with Project Goals

- Enhances security by adding an additional layer of data protection.
- Supports multi-tenant RLS security by ensuring tenant data is handled securely.
- Maintains system performance and reliability while handling PII.

## 2. Functional Requirements

1. **PII Detection Rule Engine:** Develop a rule engine capable of identifying PII in data payloads based on predefined patterns and heuristics.
2. **Configurability:** Allow administrators to define custom PII detection rules per project.
3. **Automatic Redaction:** Implement automatic redaction of detected PII before the data is stored or logged.
4. **Encryption Option:** Provide an option to encrypt PII instead of redaction, storing the encrypted form securely.
5. **Audit Trails:** Log actions related to PII detection, redaction, or encryption for auditability, excluding the PII itself.
6. **API for Rule Management:** Enable CRUD operations for PII detection rules through a secure API.

## 3. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** PII detection and redaction should not significantly impact processing times, aiming for a maximum of 10ms overhead per payload.
- **Security:** Ensure all operations related to PII handling are conducted securely, adhering to the latest best practices for data protection.
- **Reliability:** Guarantee a 99.9% success rate in correctly detecting and handling PII.
- **Maintainability:** Code should be modular, well-documented, and easy to update as new types of PII are defined.

## 4. Technical Specifications

### Architecture Context

- Integration with **SvelteKit** for rule management interfaces.
- Utilization of **Supabase Postgres** for storing PII rules and audit logs.
- Extension of the existing **Workers** architecture to include PII detection tasks.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Rule Engine Design:** Outline the architecture of the PII detection rule engine.
2. **Data Model Update:** Extend `schema.sql` to include tables for storing PII rules and audit logs.
3. **Rule Management API:** Define and implement API endpoints for managing PII detection rules.
4. **Integration Testing:** Test integration with existing components, ensuring no degradation in performance or functionality.
5. **Deployment and Monitoring:** Deploy the update in a controlled environment, monitor performance and reliability, and make adjustments as necessary.

### Data Model Changes

- `pii_rules`: Stores definitions of PII detection rules.
- `pii_audit_logs`: Records actions taken on detected PII.

### API Endpoints

- `POST /api/pii-rules`: Create a new PII detection rule.
- `GET /api/pii-rules`: List all PII detection rules.
- `PUT /api/pii-rules/{id}`: Update a PII detection rule.
- `DELETE /api/pii-rules/{id}`: Delete a PII detection rule.

## 5. Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] PII detection rule engine implemented and tested.
- [ ] Automatic redaction and encryption of PII in workflow data.
- [ ] PII rule management API endpoints defined, implemented, and documented.
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met: <10ms overhead for PII processing.
- [ ] Audit logs capture actions related to PII handling without storing PII.
- [ ] Comprehensive unit, integration, and e2e tests covering new functionality.

## 6. Dependencies and Prerequisites

- Access to the existing MeshHook codebase and development environment.
- Supabase account for database and real-time logging.
- Review of global data protection regulations for PII definition and compliance requirements.

## 7. Implementation Notes

### Development Guidelines

- Follow the existing coding standards and project structure.
- Ensure all new code is well-commented and adheres to security best practices.
- Prioritize unit and integration tests for all new features.

### Testing Strategy

- Utilize TDD for the development of the rule engine and API endpoints.
- Perform load testing to evaluate the impact on performance.
- Conduct security audits specifically focused on the handling of PII.

### Security Considerations

- Ensure all data transmission is encrypted (TLS).
- Apply the principle of least privilege to API access.
- Regularly rotate encryption keys used for PII encryption.

### Monitoring & Observability

- Implement logging for all rule management operations and PII handling actions.
- Monitor performance metrics to detect any impact from PII processing.
- Set up alerts for any failures in the PII detection and handling process.
