[CI/CD Pipeline] - [Benchmarking Suite]

note right of [Benchmark Development]
  Create and execute benchmarks to measure:
  - Webhook processing time
  - DAG builder responsiveness
  - Workflow execution time
  - Live logs delivery latency
  - RLS security performance
end note

note right of [Automation & Integration]
  Integrate benchmarking into the CI/CD pipeline for continuous performance validation.
end note

note right of [Metric Collection & Analysis]
  Collect and analyze key performance metrics to identify bottlenecks and optimization opportunities.
end note

note right of [Baseline Metrics & Regression Detection]
  Establish performance baselines and detect performance regressions in future updates.
end note

note right of [Documentation]
  Document benchmarking approach, tools, findings, and identified optimizations.
end note
