# PRD: Keyboard Shortcuts

**Issue:** [#215](https://github.com/profullstack/meshhook/issues/215)  
**Milestone:** Phase 10: Polish & Launch  
**Labels:** ux-improvements, hacktoberfest  
**Phase:** Phase 10  
**Section:** UX Improvements

---

## Overview

The inclusion of keyboard shortcuts is aimed at enhancing the user experience by enabling faster and more efficient navigation and interaction within the MeshHook platform. This feature is aligned with our goal of delivering a user-friendly, visually simple, and efficient workflow engine. Keyboard shortcuts will provide power users a way to streamline their workflow, making it easier to build, manage, and execute workflows with minimal reliance on mouse interactions.

This feature will be integrated into the existing MeshHook architecture, utilizing the SvelteKit framework for UI enhancements and ensuring compatibility with our Postgres-native event sourcing model for deterministic and durable runs.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

1. **Keyboard Shortcut Design:** Define a comprehensive set of keyboard shortcuts for critical actions within the MeshHook platform, including but not limited to:
   - Creating, duplicating, and deleting nodes
   - Initiating a test run of the current workflow
   - Navigating between different sections of the UI (e.g., workflow builder, logs view, settings)
   - Saving changes to workflows
2. **Shortcut Overlay/Help:** Implement an overlay or help section accessible via a keyboard shortcut (e.g., `?`) that lists all available keyboard shortcuts.
3. **Conflict Management:** Ensure that keyboard shortcuts do not conflict with browser defaults or accessibility features.
4. **Customization (Stretch Goal):** Allow users to customize keyboard shortcuts, including the ability to disable them.

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** Keyboard shortcuts should respond in real-time without causing noticeable delays in the UI.
- **Accessibility:** Ensure keyboard shortcuts do not hinder the platform's accessibility, providing alternative navigation options for users who rely on assistive technologies.
- **Usability:** Keyboard shortcuts should be intuitive and aligned with common patterns used in similar platforms to minimize the learning curve.

## Technical Specifications

### Architecture Context

- **Frontend:** SvelteKit/Svelte 5 for the UI implementation, including the visual DAG builder and settings UI.
- **Backend:** Supabase for real-time updates and PostgreSQL for data persistence.
- **Existing Components:** This feature will integrate with existing UI components and data models without necessitating significant changes.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Analysis:** Review current UI components and workflows to identify key actions for shortcut implementation.
2. **Design:** Draft a keyboard shortcut scheme, considering common conventions and user expectations. Prepare mockups for the shortcut overlay/help screen.
3. **Implementation:**
   - Add keyboard event listeners in the SvelteKit frontend for the defined shortcuts.
   - Develop the UI component for displaying keyboard shortcuts.
   - Implement customization options for shortcuts, if feasible within the project timeline.
4. **Testing:** Include unit and integration tests to cover new functionality. Test for accessibility and browser compatibility.
5. **Documentation:** Update the user guide and online help documentation to include a section on keyboard shortcuts.

### Data Model

No changes to the data model are anticipated for this feature. However, if customization of keyboard shortcuts is implemented, a new table or extension of an existing table may be required to store user preferences.

### API Endpoints

No new API endpoints are required for this feature.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] A predefined set of keyboard shortcuts for essential actions is implemented and functional.
- [ ] A UI component for displaying available keyboard shortcuts is accessible and informative.
- [ ] Keyboard shortcuts do not interfere with browser defaults or accessibility features.
- [ ] Documentation is updated to include information on keyboard shortcuts.
- [ ] (Stretch) Users can customize keyboard shortcuts according to their preferences.

## Dependencies

- SvelteKit and existing frontend infrastructure for implementing the UI changes.
- Supabase for any real-time updates if necessary for displaying or updating keyboard shortcuts dynamically.

## Implementation Notes

### Development Guidelines

- Follow the existing coding standards for JavaScript/TypeScript and Svelte/SvelteKit.
- Ensure that the implementation is modular and reusable where possible.
- Prioritize accessibility and internationalization in design and development.

### Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests:** For all new logic related to keyboard event handling and shortcut display.
- **Integration Tests:** To ensure keyboard shortcuts integrate seamlessly with existing functionalities.
- **Accessibility Testing:** Ensure compatibility with screen readers and adherence to WCAG guidelines.

### Security Considerations

No specific security implications are anticipated for this feature. However, standard security practices should be followed during development.

### Monitoring & Observability

- Monitor user engagement with the keyboard shortcuts feature through analytics to inform future enhancements.
- Log errors related to keyboard shortcut functionality for ongoing improvement.
