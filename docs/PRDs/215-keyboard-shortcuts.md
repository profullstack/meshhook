## Overview

<<<<<<< HEAD
The implementation of keyboard shortcuts aims to enhance the MeshHook user interface by enabling more efficient navigation and operation for power users. By reducing reliance on mouse interactions, we can significantly speed up the workflow creation, modification, and execution processes within the MeshHook platform. This feature aligns with MeshHook’s goal to deliver a visually simple and efficient workflow engine by improving user experience through fast, intuitive interactions.

### Objective

To design and implement a set of keyboard shortcuts for the MeshHook platform that enables users to perform frequent actions quickly and to provide an overlay or help modal that displays all available keyboard shortcuts.

=======
The inclusion of keyboard shortcuts is aimed at enhancing the user experience by enabling faster and more efficient navigation and interaction within the MeshHook platform. This feature is aligned with our goal of delivering a user-friendly, visually simple, and efficient workflow engine. Keyboard shortcuts will provide power users a way to streamline their workflow, making it easier to build, manage, and execute workflows with minimal reliance on mouse interactions.

This feature will be integrated into the existing MeshHook architecture, utilizing the SvelteKit framework for UI enhancements and ensuring compatibility with our Postgres-native event sourcing model for deterministic and durable runs.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

<<<<<<< HEAD
1. **Core Shortcuts:** Implement keyboard shortcuts for the following actions:
   - Create, duplicate, and delete nodes.
   - Initiate a test run of the current workflow.
   - Navigate between UI sections (workflow builder, logs view, settings).
   - Save changes to workflows.
2. **Shortcut Overlay/Help:** A modal or overlay is accessible via a keyboard shortcut (suggested `Shift + ?`) that displays all available keyboard shortcuts.
3. **Conflict Avoidance:** Keyboard shortcuts must not conflict with browser defaults or accessibility features.
4. **Customization (Stretch Goal):** Allow users to customize keyboard shortcuts, including enabling or disabling them.

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** Keyboard shortcuts must be responsive without causing delays.
- **Accessibility:** Keyboard shortcuts must be designed considering users relying on keyboard navigation, ensuring the platform remains accessible.
- **Usability:** Shortcuts should be intuitive and leverage common patterns familiar to users of similar platforms.

---
=======
1. **Keyboard Shortcut Design:** Define a comprehensive set of keyboard shortcuts for critical actions within the MeshHook platform, including but not limited to:
   - Creating, duplicating, and deleting nodes
   - Initiating a test run of the current workflow
   - Navigating between different sections of the UI (e.g., workflow builder, logs view, settings)
   - Saving changes to workflows
2. **Shortcut Overlay/Help:** Implement an overlay or help section accessible via a keyboard shortcut (e.g., `?`) that lists all available keyboard shortcuts.
3. **Conflict Management:** Ensure that keyboard shortcuts do not conflict with browser defaults or accessibility features.
4. **Customization (Stretch Goal):** Allow users to customize keyboard shortcuts, including the ability to disable them.

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** Keyboard shortcuts should respond in real-time without causing noticeable delays in the UI.
- **Accessibility:** Ensure keyboard shortcuts do not hinder the platform's accessibility, providing alternative navigation options for users who rely on assistive technologies.
- **Usability:** Keyboard shortcuts should be intuitive and aligned with common patterns used in similar platforms to minimize the learning curve.

## Technical Specifications

### Architecture Context

<<<<<<< HEAD
MeshHook uses SvelteKit/Svelte 5 for its UI, making use of Supabase for real-time updates and PostgreSQL for data persistence. The keyboard shortcuts feature will integrate seamlessly with the existing frontend infrastructure with minimal backend interaction required.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Analysis & Design:**
   - Identify frequently used actions within MeshHook for shortcut implementation.
   - Design a user-friendly and intuitive keyboard shortcut schema.
2. **Development:**
   - Implement keyboard event listeners in the SvelteKit frontend for the defined shortcuts.
   - Design and develop the UI component for displaying keyboard shortcuts.
   - Implement customization options for shortcuts, subject to project timeline constraints.
3. **Integration & Testing:**
   - Integrate the new feature with existing UI components.
   - Perform comprehensive testing, including unit, integration, and user acceptance tests.
4. **Documentation:**
   - Update user documentation and guides to include detailed information on keyboard shortcuts.

### Data Model

No changes to the existing data models are anticipated for the initial implementation of keyboard shortcuts. If customization is pursued, modifications or extensions to user preference storage may be required.

### API Endpoints

No new API endpoints will be introduced for this feature.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Core keyboard shortcuts for specified actions are implemented and functional.
- [ ] A UI component displaying all keyboard shortcuts is accessible and user-friendly.
- [ ] No conflicts with browser defaults or accessibility features are introduced.
- [ ] Documentation is updated to include a section on keyboard shortcuts.
- [ ] (Stretch) Users can customize keyboard shortcuts to their preference.

---

## Dependencies

- **Technical:** Relies on the existing SvelteKit frontend and Supabase infrastructure.
- **Prerequisites:** No prerequisite tasks identified beyond the standard development setup.

---
=======
- **Frontend:** SvelteKit/Svelte 5 for the UI implementation, including the visual DAG builder and settings UI.
- **Backend:** Supabase for real-time updates and PostgreSQL for data persistence.
- **Existing Components:** This feature will integrate with existing UI components and data models without necessitating significant changes.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Analysis:** Review current UI components and workflows to identify key actions for shortcut implementation.
2. **Design:** Draft a keyboard shortcut scheme, considering common conventions and user expectations. Prepare mockups for the shortcut overlay/help screen.
3. **Implementation:**
   - Add keyboard event listeners in the SvelteKit frontend for the defined shortcuts.
   - Develop the UI component for displaying keyboard shortcuts.
   - Implement customization options for shortcuts, if feasible within the project timeline.
4. **Testing:** Include unit and integration tests to cover new functionality. Test for accessibility and browser compatibility.
5. **Documentation:** Update the user guide and online help documentation to include a section on keyboard shortcuts.

### Data Model

No changes to the data model are anticipated for this feature. However, if customization of keyboard shortcuts is implemented, a new table or extension of an existing table may be required to store user preferences.

### API Endpoints

No new API endpoints are required for this feature.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] A predefined set of keyboard shortcuts for essential actions is implemented and functional.
- [ ] A UI component for displaying available keyboard shortcuts is accessible and informative.
- [ ] Keyboard shortcuts do not interfere with browser defaults or accessibility features.
- [ ] Documentation is updated to include information on keyboard shortcuts.
- [ ] (Stretch) Users can customize keyboard shortcuts according to their preferences.

## Dependencies

- SvelteKit and existing frontend infrastructure for implementing the UI changes.
- Supabase for any real-time updates if necessary for displaying or updating keyboard shortcuts dynamically.
