# PRD: Keyboard Shortcuts

**Issue:** [#215](https://github.com/profullstack/meshhook/issues/215)  
**Milestone:** Phase 10: Polish & Launch  
**Labels:** ux-improvements, hacktoberfest  
**Phase:** Phase 10  
**Section:** UX Improvements  

## Overview

This task aims to enhance the MeshHook user experience by introducing keyboard shortcuts, enabling users to perform common actions more efficiently. This feature aligns with MeshHook's goal of delivering an intuitive and efficient workflow engine by reducing the reliance on point-and-click interactions, thereby speeding up workflow design, execution monitoring, and general navigation within the platform.

**Objective:** Implement keyboard shortcuts to improve user experience and productivity.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

1. **Discoverability:** Users should be able to view a list of available keyboard shortcuts within the application.
2. **Common Actions:** Implement shortcuts for the following actions:
   - `Ctrl + S`: Save current workflow
   - `Ctrl + Z`: Undo last action in the workflow editor
   - `Ctrl + Shift + Z`: Redo last undone action
   - `Ctrl + F`: Focus on the search/filter input field
   - `Ctrl + P`: Toggle the preview of the current workflow
   - `Esc`: Close any open modal or dropdown menu
3. **Customization (Stretch Goal):** Allow users to customize keyboard shortcuts.
4. **Accessibility:** Ensure keyboard shortcuts do not conflict with screen readers or other accessibility tools.

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** Keyboard shortcuts should respond instantly, with no perceptible delay to the user.
- **Compatibility:** Shortcuts should work across the latest versions of major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).
- **Usability:** Shortcuts must not interfere with standard browser or operating system shortcuts.

## Technical Specifications

### Architecture Context

- **Frontend:** SvelteKit/Svelte 5 will be used for implementing the UI components needed to display and manage keyboard shortcuts.
- **Backend:** No backend changes are necessary for the initial implementation of static keyboard shortcuts. Customization features may require backend support for storing user preferences.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Analysis & Design:**
   - Identify common actions within MeshHook that can benefit from keyboard shortcuts.
   - Design a modal or dedicated settings page for displaying available shortcuts.
2. **Frontend Implementation:**
   - Use Svelte's global event handlers to listen for keyboard events.
   - Implement a keyboard shortcut manager as a Svelte store to handle the registration and execution of shortcuts.
   - Create a UI component to display shortcuts to the user.
3. **Testing & Documentation:**
   - Unit tests for the shortcut manager logic.
   - Document how to use and, if applicable, customize shortcuts within the user guide.

### Data Model Changes

- No data model changes required for the initial implementation of static shortcuts.
- For customization (stretch goal): a new table or JSON column in an existing table may be needed to store user preferences.

### API Endpoints

- No new API endpoints are required for the initial implementation.
- For customization (stretch goal): endpoints for fetching and updating user preferences may be needed.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All the listed common actions have keyboard shortcuts implemented.
- [ ] A UI component for displaying available keyboard shortcuts exists and is easily accessible.
- [ ] Keyboard shortcuts do not interfere with browser/OS defaults or accessibility tools.
- [ ] Documentation updated with a section on using keyboard shortcuts within MeshHook.
- [ ] Unit tests cover the keyboard shortcut manager logic.

## Dependencies

- SvelteKit/Svelte 5 for frontend development.
- Existing user settings management, if customization is pursued.

## Implementation Notes

### Development Guidelines

- Follow the existing project structure and coding conventions.
- Ensure keyboard shortcuts are configurable to some degree to avoid conflicts with global shortcuts.

### Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests:** For the shortcut manager and any utility functions handling keyboard events.
- **Manual Testing:** Ensure shortcuts work as expected across different browsers and do not conflict with accessibility tools.

### Security Considerations

- Ensure that keyboard shortcuts do not expose any security vulnerabilities, such as allowing unauthorized actions without proper authentication.

### Monitoring & Observability

- Monitor the usage of keyboard shortcuts if feasible to gather data for potential UX improvements.
