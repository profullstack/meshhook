# PRD: Implementation of Keyboard Shortcuts

**Issue:** [#215](https://github.com/profullstack/meshhook/issues/215)  
**Milestone:** Phase 10: Polish & Launch  
**Labels:** ux-improvements, hacktoberfest  
**Project:** MeshHook - A webhook-first, deterministic, Postgres-native workflow engine

---

## Overview

The implementation of keyboard shortcuts aims to enhance the MeshHook user interface by enabling more efficient navigation and operation for power users. By reducing reliance on mouse interactions, we can significantly speed up the workflow creation, modification, and execution processes within the MeshHook platform. This feature aligns with MeshHook’s goal to deliver a visually simple and efficient workflow engine by improving user experience through fast, intuitive interactions.

### Objective

To design and implement a set of keyboard shortcuts for the MeshHook platform that enables users to perform frequent actions quickly and to provide an overlay or help modal that displays all available keyboard shortcuts.

---

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

1. **Core Shortcuts:** Implement keyboard shortcuts for the following actions:
   - Create, duplicate, and delete nodes.
   - Initiate a test run of the current workflow.
   - Navigate between UI sections (workflow builder, logs view, settings).
   - Save changes to workflows.
2. **Shortcut Overlay/Help:** A modal or overlay is accessible via a keyboard shortcut (suggested `Shift + ?`) that displays all available keyboard shortcuts.
3. **Conflict Avoidance:** Keyboard shortcuts must not conflict with browser defaults or accessibility features.
4. **Customization (Stretch Goal):** Allow users to customize keyboard shortcuts, including enabling or disabling them.

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** Keyboard shortcuts must be responsive without causing delays.
- **Accessibility:** Keyboard shortcuts must be designed considering users relying on keyboard navigation, ensuring the platform remains accessible.
- **Usability:** Shortcuts should be intuitive and leverage common patterns familiar to users of similar platforms.

## Technical Specifications

### Architecture Context

MeshHook uses SvelteKit/Svelte 5 for its UI, making use of Supabase for real-time updates and PostgreSQL for data persistence. The keyboard shortcuts feature will integrate seamlessly with the existing frontend infrastructure with minimal backend interaction required.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Analysis & Design:**
   - Identify frequently used actions within MeshHook for shortcut implementation.
   - Design a user-friendly and intuitive keyboard shortcut schema.
2. **Development:**
   - Implement keyboard event listeners in the SvelteKit frontend for the defined shortcuts.
   - Design and develop the UI component for displaying keyboard shortcuts.
   - Implement customization options for shortcuts, subject to project timeline constraints.
3. **Integration & Testing:**
   - Integrate the new feature with existing UI components.
   - Perform comprehensive testing, including unit, integration, and user acceptance tests.
4. **Documentation:**
   - Update user documentation and guides to include detailed information on keyboard shortcuts.

### Data Model

No changes to the existing data models are anticipated for the initial implementation of keyboard shortcuts. If customization is pursued, modifications or extensions to user preference storage may be required.

### API Endpoints

No new API endpoints will be introduced for this feature.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Core keyboard shortcuts for specified actions are implemented and functional.
- [ ] A UI component displaying all keyboard shortcuts is accessible and user-friendly.
- [ ] No conflicts with browser defaults or accessibility features are introduced.
- [ ] Documentation is updated to include a section on keyboard shortcuts.
- [ ] (Stretch) Users can customize keyboard shortcuts to their preference.

---

## Dependencies

- **Technical:** Relies on the existing SvelteKit frontend and Supabase infrastructure.
- **Prerequisites:** No prerequisite tasks identified beyond the standard development setup.

---

## Implementation Notes

### Development Guidelines

- Adhere to the project’s established coding standards and patterns for Svelte/SvelteKit.
- Ensure modularity and reusability of the new components where feasible.
- Prioritize accessibility, considering both traditional and keyboard-only users.

### Testing Strategy

- Develop unit tests for new logic introduced, particularly for the keyboard event handling.
- Conduct integration tests to ensure seamless functionality with existing features.
- Perform accessibility testing, ensuring compatibility with screen readers and adherence to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG).

### Security Considerations

This feature does not directly introduce new security considerations. However, adherence to general security best practices, such as input validation (for customizable shortcuts, if implemented), is required.

### Monitoring & Observability

- Implement logging for key actions within the shortcut functionality for troubleshooting and monitoring.
- Utilize analytics to track the usage of keyboard shortcuts and identify potential areas for enhancement.
