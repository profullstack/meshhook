# PRD: Implementation of Keyboard Shortcuts for MeshHook

## Overview

This document outlines the plan for implementing keyboard shortcuts within the MeshHook platform. This feature aims to enhance the user experience by providing an efficient means for users to perform common actions within the MeshHook workflow engine. It aligns with MeshHook's goals of delivering a user-friendly, efficient, and accessible platform for managing workflows.

### Objectives

- To provide an intuitive means for users to navigate and interact with MeshHook, enhancing overall productivity.
- To reduce the time required to create, modify, and manage workflows by introducing keyboard shortcuts for common actions.
- To ensure that the implementation of keyboard shortcuts adheres to accessibility standards, making the platform accessible to all users.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

1. **Implementation of Core Keyboard Shortcuts:**
   - `Ctrl + N`: Create a new workflow node.
   - `Ctrl + D`: Duplicate the currently selected node(s).
   - `Delete`: Remove the currently selected node(s).
   - `Ctrl + R`: Execute the current workflow.
   - `Ctrl + S`: Save the current workflow.
   - Additional shortcuts for navigating between the workflow builder, logs view, and settings.

2. **Help Modal for Keyboard Shortcuts:**
   - A modal accessible via `Shift + ?`, displaying a comprehensive list of all available keyboard shortcuts.

3. **Conflict Avoidance:**
   - Ensure that implemented shortcuts do not conflict with browser defaults or accessibility shortcuts.

4. **Customization (Optional):**
   - Allow users to customize keyboard shortcuts, including the option to disable them, if feasible within the project scope.

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** Keyboard shortcuts must be responsive with minimal latency.
- **Accessibility:** Implementation must not compromise the platformâ€™s accessibility, adhering to WCAG guidelines.
- **Usability:** Chosen shortcuts should be intuitive and follow established conventions for similar applications.

## Technical Specifications

### Architecture Context

MeshHook is built on SvelteKit/Svelte 5 with a PostgreSQL database for persistence and Supabase for real-time functionalities. The addition of keyboard shortcuts is primarily a front-end enhancement, requiring minimal back-end adjustments, except for potential shortcut customization features.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Design Phase:**
   - Identify and map out the most commonly used actions within MeshHook to assign keyboard shortcuts.
   - Design a user-friendly help modal for displaying shortcuts.

2. **Development Phase:**
   - Implement keyboard event listeners within the SvelteKit application to handle the defined shortcuts.
   - Develop the UI component for the help modal, ensuring it is accessible and adheres to MeshHook's design system.
   - (Optional) Create a back-end infrastructure for storing user-defined shortcut preferences, should the customization feature be pursued.

3. **Integration and Testing Phase:**
   - Integrate the new keyboard shortcut functionality with existing front-end components, ensuring a seamless user experience.
   - Perform thorough testing, including unit, integration, and accessibility testing, to ensure the feature works as expected across all supported browsers.

4. **Documentation Phase:**
   - Update the MeshHook documentation to include a section dedicated to keyboard shortcuts, detailing their use and customization (if applicable).

### Data Model Changes

For shortcut customization:
- A new table `user_shortcut_preferences` may be introduced to store user-specific shortcut configurations.

### API Endpoints

For customization (optional):
- `POST /api/user/preferences/shortcuts` to save user-defined shortcut preferences.
- `GET /api/user/preferences/shortcuts` to retrieve user-defined shortcut preferences.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Core keyboard shortcuts (`Ctrl + N`, `Ctrl + D`, `Delete`, `Ctrl + R`, `Ctrl + S`) are implemented and functional in all major browsers.
- A help modal displaying all keyboard shortcuts is accessible via `Shift + ?` and meets accessibility standards.
- Keyboard shortcuts do not conflict with browser defaults or impair accessibility.
- Documentation thoroughly explains the available shortcuts and, if implemented, the customization process.
- (Optional) Users can customize keyboard shortcuts according to their preferences.

## Dependencies

- Existing SvelteKit and Supabase infrastructure.
- User interface components for modals and notifications, if not already available.

## Implementation Notes

### Development Guidelines

- Adhere to MeshHook's existing coding and design standards.
- Ensure new components are fully responsive and accessible.
- Keyboard event handling should be efficient and not interfere with the platform's overall performance.

### Testing Strategy

- Unit tests for new components and utility functions.
- Integration tests to verify that keyboard shortcuts work as expected within the broader application context.
- Accessibility testing to ensure keyboard shortcuts and the help modal are accessible according to WCAG guidelines.

### Security Considerations

- Validate user input for customization features to prevent injection attacks.
- Ensure that any changes to the back end follow MeshHook's established security practices, including data encryption and secure API design.

### Monitoring and Observability

- Monitor the usage of keyboard shortcuts to gather insights on user preferences and potential areas for improvement.
- Implement logging for key actions to aid in troubleshooting and user support.

By following this PRD, MeshHook will introduce an intuitive, efficient, and accessible method for users to interact with the platform, reinforcing its position as a user-centric workflow engine.
