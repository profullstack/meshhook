# PRD: Event Sourcing Replay Tests

**Issue:** [#180](https://github.com/profullstack/meshhook/issues/180)  
**Milestone:** Phase 7: Testing  
**Labels:** integration-tests, hacktoberfest  
**Phase:** Phase 7  
**Section:** Integration Tests

---

## 1. Overview

The purpose of this task is to ensure that MeshHook's event sourcing mechanism operates correctly across various scenarios, including failure recovery and system restarts. This aligns with MeshHook's goal of providing durable, replayable runs via event sourcing, which is crucial for maintaining the integrity and reliability of the workflow engine. By implementing event sourcing replay tests, we aim to validate the system's ability to reproduce previous states accurately, ensuring deterministic behavior in workflow executions.

## 2. Functional Requirements

1. **Test Suite Creation:** Develop a comprehensive suite of integration tests focusing on event sourcing replay capabilities.
2. **Scenario Coverage:** Cover a range of scenarios including but not limited to:
   - Normal workflow execution replays.
   - Replays after system failures.
   - Replays after manual intervention in the workflow state.
3. **Failure Injection:** Include tests that simulate system failures (e.g., database disconnection, application crash) to verify recovery and replay capabilities.
4. **Edge Case Identification:** Identify and test edge cases in event sourcing logic, ensuring the system behaves as expected under all conditions.
5. **Automated Execution:** Integrate the test suite into the CI/CD pipeline for automated execution against pull requests and merges.

## 3. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** Ensure that the replay mechanism does not introduce significant latency or degrade system performance.
- **Reliability:** Achieve a high level of confidence in the event sourcing mechanism's reliability through thorough testing.
- **Security:** Maintain the existing security posture, ensuring that test execution and data handling do not introduce vulnerabilities.

## 4. Technical Specifications

### Architecture Context

MeshHook utilizes a Postgres-native event sourcing model, with Supabase for real-time log streaming and state management. The technical implementation of this task must consider integration with:

- **Supabase Realtime:** For observing and verifying live log outputs during test runs.
- **Postgres Database:** Specifically focusing on the event sourcing tables and replay logic.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Review Existing Documentation:** Understand the current event sourcing mechanism and identify documented edge cases or failure scenarios.
2. **Design Test Scenarios:** Based on the review, design a comprehensive set of test scenarios covering successful replays, failure recoveries, and edge cases.
3. **Implement Test Suite:** Develop the test suite using the chosen testing framework, adhering to MeshHook's coding standards.
4. **Integrate with CI/CD:** Automate test execution within the existing CI/CD pipeline, ensuring tests run against new changes.
5. **Document Findings:** Update documentation with any new edge cases or behaviors discovered during testing.

### Data Model

No changes to the data model are required for the implementation of this task. Should adjustments become necessary, they will be documented and reviewed according to the project's schema change process.

### API Endpoints

N/A - This task focuses on testing internal mechanisms and does not introduce new API endpoints.

## 5. Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Integration test suite for event sourcing replay is implemented and documented.
- [ ] All designed test scenarios pass successfully, confirming the reliability of the replay mechanism.
- [ ] No degradation in performance metrics post-test implementation.
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline successfully executes the new test suite on relevant triggers.
- [ ] Documentation is updated with any new findings or edge cases identified during testing.

## 6. Dependencies and Prerequisites

- Access to the MeshHook codebase and existing CI/CD pipeline.
- Availability of a testing environment with Supabase and Postgres configured.
- Completion of prior phases, ensuring the event sourcing mechanism is implemented and operational.

## 7. Implementation Notes

### Development Guidelines

- Follow the existing MeshHook coding standards and project structure.
- Use Jest or a similar testing framework for implementing integration tests.
- Emphasize clarity and maintainability in test code, documenting the purpose and expected outcome of each test scenario.

### Testing Strategy

- **Integration Testing**: Focus on the interaction between the event sourcing mechanism and the database, ensuring accurate state replays.
- **Failure Injection Testing**: Simulate various failure scenarios to validate the system's resilience and recovery capabilities.

### Security Considerations

- Ensure that test executions do not expose sensitive information.
- Validate that replay operations adhere to MeshHook's security guidelines, especially regarding multi-tenancy and data isolation.

### Monitoring & Observability

- Utilize Supabase Realtime for monitoring test runs, ensuring live log streams are consistent with expected outcomes.
- Observe performance metrics during test executions to detect any impact on system responsiveness or resource usage.
