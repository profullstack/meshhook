# PRD: Alert Configuration UI

## Overview
The Alert Configuration UI aims to enhance MeshHook's observability capabilities by allowing users to configure alerts based on metrics or events within their workflow executions. This feature aligns with MeshHook's goals of providing a comprehensive, accessible, and secure workflow engine by enabling proactive monitoring and management. By integrating this UI, MeshHook will offer users a powerful tool to ensure their workflows run smoothly and efficiently, addressing potential issues promptly.

### Objectives:
- Enhance the observability and management capabilities within MeshHook.
- Provide a user-friendly interface for configuring alerts, improving user experience and satisfaction.
- Ensure the feature's security and efficiency, adhering to MeshHook's high standards.

## Functional Requirements
1. **Alert Configuration Interface**: A Svelte 5 based UI that allows users to create, modify, view, and delete alert configurations with ease and efficiency.
2. **Criteria-Based Alerts**: Users must be able to set alerts based on specific metrics (e.g., execution duration, error rates) or events (e.g., task completion/failure).
3. **Secure Multi-Tenancy**: The UI should respect MeshHook's multi-tenant architecture, ensuring users access only their configurations in compliance with RLS security policies.
4. **Seamless Integration**: The UI must integrate fluidly with MeshHook's existing systems, particularly the backend and existing data models, to support alert configurations.

## Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance**: The UI should be highly responsive, with actions completing in under one second under normal operating conditions.
- **Reliability**: Aim for 99.9% uptime for the alert configuration feature, with robust error handling to maintain continuous operation.
- **Security**: Follow MeshHook's security guidelines, ensuring all interactions within the UI are secure, especially regarding data handling and multi-tenant access.
- **Maintainability**: The implementation should prioritize clean, well-documented code that adheres to MeshHook's coding standards, ensuring ease of maintenance and future enhancements.

## Technical Specifications

### Architecture Context
- The UI will be developed with SvelteKit, leveraging Svelte 5 for component development, ensuring a modern, efficient user experience.
- Integration with Supabase for backend operations, utilizing existing infrastructure for data storage and retrieval within a secure, multi-tenant environment.

### Implementation Approach
1. **UI Design**: Create wireframes and designs that align with MeshHook's aesthetic and usability standards.
2. **Data Model Extension**: Assess and update the database schema to support alert configurations, potentially adding a new table or modifying existing structures.
3. **Svelte Components**: Develop reusable Svelte components for the alert configuration UI, focusing on performance and user experience.
4. **Backend Integration**: Ensure the UI components interact seamlessly with the backend, facilitating CRUD operations for alert configurations through secure APIs.
5. **Testing & Documentation**: Conduct comprehensive testing (unit and integration) and document the feature extensively, covering both user interactions and technical integrations.

### Data Model Changes
- Introduce a new table, `alert_configurations`, with fields for user/project IDs, alert criteria, thresholds, and notification settings.

### API Endpoints
- Implement new RESTful endpoints for alert configurations: `POST /alerts`, `GET /alerts`, `PUT /alerts/{id}`, `DELETE /alerts/{id}`.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Users can intuitively create, edit, view, and delete alert configurations via the UI.
- [ ] Configurations allow for alerts based on precise criteria, enhancing observability.
- [ ] The UI maintains high performance and reliability standards.
- [ ] All interactions within the UI adhere to MeshHook's security and multi-tenancy guidelines.
- [ ] Documentation is comprehensive, covering usage and technical details.

## Dependencies
- Access to MeshHook's current development environment and codebase.
- SvelteKit and Svelte 5 for frontend development.
- Supabase for backend services.

## Implementation Notes

### Development Guidelines
- Follow MeshHook's coding conventions and best practices, using ES2024+ features for clean, efficient code.
- Adopt a Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach to ensure reliability and facilitate maintenance.
- Use ESLint and Prettier for code formatting and linting, maintaining code quality.

### Testing Strategy
- Develop unit tests for individual components and functions, ensuring they perform as expected.
- Conduct integration tests to verify that the new UI works seamlessly with existing systems and workflows.
- Perform manual tests to cover user interaction flows, validating usability and functionality.

### Security Considerations
- Implement input validation to prevent injection and other common web vulnerabilities.
- Ensure alert configuration data is appropriately scoped to prevent unauthorized access in a multi-tenant context.
- Encrypt sensitive information related to alert configurations to protect user data.

### Monitoring & Observability
- Integrate detailed logging throughout the alert configuration process to facilitate monitoring and troubleshooting.
- Leverage Supabase Realtime where applicable to provide users with live feedback and updates.

By adhering to this PRD, the development and integration of the Alert Configuration UI will significantly enhance MeshHook's observability capabilities, offering users valuable tools for monitoring and managing their workflows effectively.
