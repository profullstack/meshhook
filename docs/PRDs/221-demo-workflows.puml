Demos --> DAG : Utilizes for workflow creation
Demos --> Supabase : Leverages for real-time functionality\nand security
Demos --> API : Uses for workflow\nexecution and monitoring
Demos --> DB : Accesses for data storage\nand retrieval
External --> API : Triggers workflows\nwith webhooks

note right of Demos : - API Data Aggregation\n- Automated Notification Systems\n- Complex Multi-Step Processes

note right of External : Includes webhook triggers\nwith signature verification
