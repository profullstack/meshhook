# PRD: JMESPath Examples

## Overview

The task of incorporating JMESPath examples into the MeshHook documentation is designed to enhance user understanding and adoption of the platform by providing clear, practical examples of JMESPath usage within MeshHook workflows. JMESPath, a query language for JSON, allows users to filter, transform, and extract data, playing a critical role in the transform nodes of MeshHook workflows. By demonstrating its utility and versatility through examples, we aim to empower users to more effectively manipulate and utilize their data within MeshHook, aligning with MeshHook's core goals of simplicity, durability, and enhanced user experience.

### Objectives

- Improve user documentation with practical, diverse JMESPath examples.
- Align examples with typical use cases encountered by MeshHook users to showcase real-world application.
- Enhance user ability to craft effective data transformations, thereby optimizing workflow efficiency and effectiveness.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

1. **JMESPath Example Creation:** Develop a comprehensive set of JMESPath examples that demonstrate basic to advanced usage, tailored to common data manipulation needs in MeshHook workflows.
2. **Integration with User Documentation:** Embed these examples within the existing user documentation structure, ensuring they are easily accessible and contextually relevant.
3. **Documentation Usability Enhancements:** Include a brief overview of JMESPath syntax and principles for users unfamiliar with the query language.

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **Usability:** Examples must be clear, concise, and accompanied by explanations that elucidate their purpose and functionality.
- **Performance:** Documentation should load promptly, maintaining the overall responsiveness of the MeshHook documentation site.
- **Maintainability:** Examples should be easy to update or extend as MeshHook evolves or as additional common use cases are identified.

## Technical Specifications

### Architecture Context

Given the task's focus on documentation enhancement, direct impacts on the core architecture are minimal. However, the integration points include:

- **User Documentation Site:** Hosted with SvelteKit, ensuring that the JMESPath examples are optimally integrated and presented within the existing documentation framework.
- **Workflow Editor (SvelteKit/Svelte 5):** Indirectly impacted by providing reference material that can assist users during the workflow creation process.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Research and Analysis:** Identify common data transformation needs and challenges faced by MeshHook users that can be addressed with JMESPath.
2. **Example Development:** Craft a range of examples, from basic to advanced, ensuring coverage of various data manipulation scenarios.
3. **Documentation Integration:** Embed the examples within the existing documentation, organizing them logically and ensuring they are accompanied by clear, explanatory text.
4. **Review and Feedback:** Subject the updated documentation to peer review, incorporating feedback to refine and improve the examples and accompanying explanations.

### Data Model

N/A for this task.

### API Endpoints

N/A for this task.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] At least 10 JMESPath examples integrated into the documentation, covering a spectrum from basic to advanced use cases.
- [ ] Each example is accompanied by explanatory text that clarifies its purpose and functionality.
- [ ] Documentation changes reviewed and approved by at least two members of the technical writing or engineering team.
- [ ] No significant performance degradation in documentation site responsiveness post-integration.
- [ ] Positive feedback from a sample group of users regarding the utility and clarity of the examples.

## Dependencies and Prerequisites

- Access to current MeshHook documentation repository and permissions to make updates.
- Familiarity with existing MeshHook documentation structure and content management system.
- Basic knowledge of JMESPath and its application within MeshHook.

## Implementation Notes

### Development Guidelines

- Follow existing documentation style and formatting conventions to ensure consistency.
- Use markdown for documentation updates, adhering to established markdown linting rules.

### Testing Strategy

- **Peer Review:** Subject the updated documentation to peer review for accuracy, clarity, and coherence.
- **User Feedback:** Solicit feedback from a small group of MeshHook users or internal testers to validate the usefulness and understandability of the examples.

### Security Considerations

- Ensure that all examples adhere to best practices for secure data handling, avoiding the inclusion of sensitive or personally identifiable information.

### Monitoring & Observability

- Monitor webpage analytics to assess user engagement with the updated documentation sections, using metrics such as page views and time on page to gauge interest and utility.
