# PRD: Workflow List View

## Overview

The Workflow List View is a critical component of the MeshHook project, aimed at enhancing the user experience by providing an efficient and intuitive interface for managing workflows. This task aligns with MeshHook's goal to deliver a robust, Postgres-native workflow engine that combines the visual simplicity of n8n and the durability of Temporal, ensuring ease of use without compromising on functionality.

**Objective:**  
To implement a user-friendly, performant, and secure list view for workflows, enabling users to view, sort, and manage their workflows efficiently.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

1. **List View Implementation:** Display a list of user workflows with essential details such as name, status (active, paused, errors), last run time, and creation date.
2. **Sorting and Filtering:** Enable users to sort workflows by name, status, last run time, and creation date. Provide filtering capabilities to view workflows based on status and other criteria.
3. **Navigation and Actions:** Allow users to navigate to individual workflow details, and perform actions such as edit, delete, and toggle status (activate/pause) directly from the list view.
4. **Responsive Design:** Ensure the workflow list view is responsive and accessible across devices and screen sizes.
5. **Integration with Backend:** Leverage existing API endpoints for fetching, sorting, and filtering workflows. Implement any required changes or additional endpoints.
6. **User Feedback:** Provide immediate visual feedback for actions (e.g., loading indicators, success/error messages).

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** Ensure the interface renders quickly and efficiently, even with a large number of workflows.
- **Reliability:** The list view should accurately reflect the current state of workflows, updating in real-time where necessary.
- **Security:** Adhere to MeshHook's security guidelines, especially regarding multi-tenancy and data access controls.
- **Maintainability:** Follow code standards and practices established in the MeshHook project to ensure code quality and ease of maintenance.

## Technical Specifications

### Architecture Context

MeshHook leverages a combination of SvelteKit for the frontend and Supabase (Postgres, Realtime) for the backend, with a focus on security through RLS and performance via efficient data handling.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Design Mock-ups:** Create UI/UX design mock-ups for the list view, ensuring alignment with MeshHook's visual language.
2. **API Contract Definition:** Collaborate with backend developers to define or refine API contracts for workflow data retrieval.
3. **Frontend Development:**
   - Implement the UI based on the mock-ups using SvelteKit.
   - Integrate with existing or newly defined API endpoints for data fetching.
   - Implement client-side logic for sorting, filtering, and actions.
4. **Backend Adjustments:** Make necessary adjustments to API endpoints or database queries to support efficient data retrieval and actions performed from the list view.
5. **Testing:** Conduct thorough testing, including unit, integration, and user acceptance tests.
6. **Documentation:** Update project documentation and API docs to reflect any new changes or endpoints introduced.

### Data Model

No new data model changes are anticipated specifically for this view. The existing workflow data structures and relationships should suffice. Any adjustments identified during implementation will be documented and applied following project procedures.

### API Endpoints

Leverage existing workflow management API endpoints. If adjustments or new endpoints are needed, they will be specified during the design and implementation phase.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Workflow list view implemented as per design mock-ups.
- [ ] Efficient data fetching, with support for sorting and filtering.
- [ ] Responsive design, accessible across different devices.
- [ ] Integration with backend API endpoints verified.
- [ ] User actions (edit, delete, toggle status) functional and providing immediate feedback.
- [ ] All code changes are well-documented and follow project standards.
- [ ] Security guidelines are adhered to, with appropriate data access controls.
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met, with quick load times even for large datasets.

## Dependencies

- SvelteKit and Supabase infrastructure already in place.
- Access to existing API documentation and backend codebase.
- UI/UX design resources.

## Implementation Notes

### Development Guidelines

- Follow the SvelteKit framework conventions for frontend development.
- Use async/await for handling asynchronous API calls.
- Adhere to secure coding practices, especially for data handling and user interaction.

### Testing Strategy

- Implement unit tests for new frontend components and logic.
- Conduct integration tests to ensure frontend-backend interaction is seamless.
- Perform manual testing for user experience verification.

### Security Considerations

- Ensure all user data displayed in the list view respects RLS policies.
- Validate and sanitize user input for actions initiated from the list view.

### Monitoring & Observability

- Implement logging for key actions and events within the list view.
- Monitor performance metrics to identify and address any bottlenecks.

## Related Documentation

- Existing project documentation (PRD, Architecture, Security Guidelines).
- API documentation for workflow management endpoints.
- SvelteKit and Supabase documentation for frontend and backend integration.
