# PRD: Authentication Flow

## Overview

The Authentication Flow task is a crucial component of the MeshHook project's Phase 3: Frontend (SvelteKit) development. MeshHook aims to provide a powerful, webhook-first, deterministic, Postgres-native workflow engine with features like webhook triggers with signature verification and a visual DAG builder. The task focuses on establishing a secure, efficient, and user-friendly authentication process, aligning with MeshHook's core goals of security, reliability, and ease of use.

**Objective:** Develop and integrate an authentication flow that supports MeshHook's multi-tenant architecture and leverages Supabase for backend services.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

1. **Authentication Mechanism:** Implement a secure authentication flow using OAuth 2.0 with Supabase as the authentication provider.
2. **User Sessions:** Manage user sessions to ensure a smooth user experience while maintaining security.
3. **Multi-tenancy Support:** Ensure the authentication flow supports multi-tenant access control, aligning with MeshHook's RLS security model.
4. **Error Handling:** Implement robust error handling for the authentication process to guide users through recovery actions on authentication failures.

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** Ensure the authentication process completes within 2 seconds to maintain a responsive user experience.
- **Reliability:** Achieve 99.9% uptime for the authentication service, with comprehensive logging and monitoring for troubleshooting.
- **Security:** Implement secure storage and handling of authentication tokens, adherence to OWASP security standards, and regular security audits.
- **Maintainability:** Code should be clean, well-documented, and modular to facilitate future updates or changes to the authentication flow.

## Technical Specifications

### Architecture Context

The Authentication Flow will integrate with the following MeshHook components:

- **Frontend (SvelteKit/SSR/API):** The SvelteKit frontend will serve as the user interface for the authentication process.
- **Backend (Supabase):** Supabase Auth will be utilized to manage user authentication, session management, and user data.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Research and Planning:** Review Supabase Auth documentation and best practices for OAuth 2.0 implementations.
2. **Design:** Outline the authentication flow, including UI/UX for login, signup, password recovery, and multi-factor authentication (if applicable).
3. **Development:**
   - Integrate Supabase Auth with the SvelteKit frontend.
   - Implement UI components for authentication, leveraging SvelteKit's reactivity.
   - Configure secure session management.
4. **Testing:** Write and execute unit tests, integration tests, and E2E tests for the authentication flow.
5. **Deployment:** Deploy changes in a staging environment for internal testing, followed by production deployment upon approval.
6. **Documentation:** Update the project documentation to include details of the authentication flow, including setup, configuration, and usage guidelines.

### Data Model

No new data model changes required specifically for authentication. Utilize existing user tables and authentication logs in Supabase.

### API Endpoints

No new API endpoints required for this task. Utilize Supabase Auth APIs for authentication-related functionalities.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] OAuth 2.0 authentication flow implemented using Supabase Auth.
- [ ] User can sign up, login, log out, and recover passwords securely.
- [ ] Session management is secure and provides a seamless user experience.
- [ ] Authentication flow supports multi-tenancy, aligning with the project's RLS security model.
- [ ] Comprehensive tests (unit, integration, E2E) are written and passing.
- [ ] Documentation for the authentication flow is complete and accessible.
- [ ] Security audit performed with no critical issues found.

## Dependencies

- Access to Supabase project with Auth configured.
- SvelteKit frontend setup.
- Existing user and authentication log schemas in Supabase.

## Implementation Notes

### Development Guidelines

- Follow the existing coding standards and best practices for SvelteKit and JavaScript.
- Use async/await for asynchronous operations.
- Ensure all user input is validated and sanitized to prevent injection attacks.

### Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests:** Focus on individual functions and components.
- **Integration Tests:** Test the integration between the frontend, Supabase Auth, and session management.
- **E2E Tests:** Simulate real user scenarios covering the entire authentication flow.

### Security Considerations

- Implement CSRF protection for the authentication flow.
- Ensure secure transmission of authentication tokens (HTTPS only).
- Store tokens securely using HttpOnly cookies or secure, client-side storage.
- Regularly rotate session tokens and enforce token expiration.

### Monitoring & Observability

- Implement logging for authentication attempts, successes, and failures.
- Monitor performance metrics (response times) and error rates for the authentication process.
- Set up alerts for abnormal activities (e.g., repeated failed login attempts).

By following this PRD, MeshHook will have a secure, efficient, and user-friendly authentication flow, enhancing the overall user experience and maintaining the project's high standards for security and reliability.
