# PRD: Queue Throughput Tests

## Overview

This Product Requirements Document (PRD) outlines the requirements and approach for implementing queue throughput tests for MeshHook, a webhook-first, deterministic, Postgres-native workflow engine. This task aligns with MeshHook's Phase 7 milestone, focusing on performance testing to ensure the system's reliability, efficiency, and scalability under varying loads. Queue throughput testing is critical to validate the system's ability to handle expected traffic volumes efficiently, identifying potential bottlenecks and areas for optimization.

### Objective

To implement and execute tests that measure the throughput of MeshHook's queueing system, ensuring it meets or exceeds performance benchmarks essential for real-world deployment scenarios. This will contribute to MeshHook's goals of providing a robust, scalable workflow engine.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

1. **Test Design:** Design tests that accurately measure the throughput of the queueing system under various conditions, including different load patterns and data volumes.
2. **Benchmark Establishment:** Establish baseline performance metrics for queue throughput under nominal system load.
3. **Load Testing:** Implement automated tests that simulate realistic and peak load conditions to measure how the queueing system performs, focusing on message processing rates and latency.
4. **Analysis and Reporting:** Analyze test results to identify bottlenecks or performance degradation points, providing detailed reports on findings.
5. **Optimization Recommendations:** Based on test outcomes, recommend optimizations or adjustments to the queueing system configuration to enhance throughput.

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** The queueing system must maintain high throughput and low latency, ensuring efficient processing even under peak loads.
- **Reliability:** The testing framework and methodologies should provide consistent, repeatable results under similar test conditions.
- **Scalability:** Identify scaling thresholds and provide recommendations for scaling the system to handle increased loads.
- **Automatability:** Tests should be automated, allowing for easy rerunning and integration into continuous integration pipelines.

## Technical Specifications

### Architecture Context

MeshHook utilizes a Postgres-based queueing mechanism, leveraging pg-boss or pgmq, to manage workflow execution jobs. This component is crucial for the system's overall performance and reliability, serving as the backbone for job scheduling and execution.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Preparation:**
   - Review the current queueing implementation and identify key performance indicators (KPIs).
   - Select or develop tools for load generation and performance measurement.

2. **Test Development:**
   - Develop automated test scripts that simulate realistic workloads, focusing on enqueue and dequeue operations.
   - Incorporate variability in test parameters to cover a broad range of scenarios.

3. **Execution:**
   - Run tests, starting from low to peak loads, gradually increasing the volume of jobs processed through the queue.
   - Monitor system resources and performance metrics continuously.

4. **Analysis:**
   - Collect and analyze performance data to identify throughput capabilities and limitations.
   - Document findings, highlighting any performance issues or bottlenecks.

5. **Optimization:**
   - Based on analysis, suggest configuration changes or optimizations.
   - Re-test to validate improvements.

### Data Model

No changes to the data model are required specifically for this task. However, performance test results should be documented and stored for historical reference and future analysis.

### API Endpoints

N/A - This task focuses on internal performance testing and does not introduce new API endpoints.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Test scripts for queue throughput are developed and documented.
- [ ] Baseline performance benchmarks for queue throughput are established.
- [ ] Automated tests simulate varying load conditions and accurately measure throughput.
- [ ] Test results are analyzed, documented, and include actionable recommendations for optimization.
- [ ] Performance optimizations are validated through subsequent testing.

## Dependencies

- Access to the current MeshHook development environment and queueing system.
- Availability of tools and resources for generating load and measuring performance.

## Implementation Notes

### Development Guidelines

- Follow the existing code standards and practices for MeshHook development.
- Utilize existing libraries and frameworks for performance testing to avoid reinventing the wheel.
- Ensure tests are modular, configurable, and reusable for future testing needs.

### Testing Strategy

- **Unit Testing:** Ensure individual components of the test framework are functioning correctly.
- **Integration Testing:** Verify that the test scripts interact correctly with the queueing system.
- **Performance Testing:** Execute the designed tests under varying conditions, closely monitoring system performance and behavior.

### Security Considerations

- Ensure that performance testing activities do not expose sensitive data or compromise system security.
- Follow MeshHook's security guidelines for handling test data and interacting with the system.

### Monitoring and Observability

- Utilize existing monitoring tools to track system performance during tests.
- Collect logs and metrics relevant to queue performance for in-depth analysis.

This PRD provides a structured approach for implementing and executing queue throughput tests, ensuring MeshHook's queueing system meets the necessary performance criteria for reliable, efficient operation.
