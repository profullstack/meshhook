# PRD: Run List View

**Issue:** [#130](https://github.com/profullstack/meshhook/issues/130)  
**Milestone:** Phase 3: Frontend (SvelteKit)  
**Labels:** run-console, hacktoberfest  
**Owner:** Anthony Ettinger  
**License:** MIT  

## Overview

The Run List View is a crucial component of the Run Console section in MeshHook, designed to provide users with a comprehensive, real-time overview of workflow runs. This feature aligns with MeshHook's commitment to delivering a webhook-first, deterministic, Postgres-native workflow engine that combines the visual simplicity of n8n and the durability of Temporal, all under a non-restrictive license.

**Objective:** Implement a Run List View that allows users to easily monitor, search, and manage workflow runs, enhancing the overall user experience and observability of the system.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

1. **List Display:** Present a paginated list of workflow runs with essential details (ID, status, start time, end time, duration).
2. **Filtering and Sorting:** Enable users to filter runs by status and sort by start time.
3. **Search Functionality:** Allow searching for runs by ID or related workflow name.
4. **Real-time Updates:** Integrate with Supabase Realtime to refresh the list as new runs are initiated or existing runs update.
5. **Run Detail Navigation:** Clicking on a run entry navigates to a detailed view of the run.
6. **Responsive Design:** Ensure the view is responsive and accessible on various devices.

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** Ensure the interface loads within 2 seconds and can handle real-time updates without perceptible lag.
- **Reliability:** Achieve 99.9% uptime for the run list view, with comprehensive error and exception handling.
- **Security:** Adhere to the project's security guidelines, especially regarding data access and display.
- **Maintainability:** Code should be modular, well-documented, and easy to update or extend.

## Technical Specifications

### Architecture Context

The Run List View will be built using SvelteKit, leveraging Supabase Realtime for live updates. This feature integrates with the existing frontend architecture and requires interaction with the backend for fetching and subscribing to run updates.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Design Mockups:** Begin with creating UI/UX mockups for the run list view, considering mobile and desktop layouts.
2. **Supabase Subscription:** Implement a Supabase Realtime subscription to the runs table, ensuring efficient data fetching and updates.
3. **Frontend Development:** Using SvelteKit, develop the frontend components based on the design mockups, including list, search, filter, and pagination functionalities.
4. **Integration Testing:** Ensure the new view works seamlessly with existing frontend components and backend services, particularly the data fetching and real-time updates.
5. **Performance Optimization:** Optimize the view's performance, focusing on loading times and responsiveness to data updates.
6. **Security Review:** Conduct a security review to ensure that user data is handled and displayed securely, following the project's security guidelines.

### Data Model

No changes to the data model are required for this task. The implementation will utilize existing tables and relationships, particularly focusing on the `runs` table.

### API Endpoints

No new API endpoints will be introduced. The view will rely on existing endpoints for fetching run data and Supabase Realtime for subscriptions.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] The run list view displays a paginated list of workflow runs with relevant details.
- [ ] Users can filter, sort, and search runs as specified.
- [ ] Real-time updates are reflected in the view without manual page refreshes.
- [ ] The implementation is responsive and functions across different devices.
- [ ] Performance benchmarks are met, with the interface loading within 2 seconds.
- [ ] Security review confirms adherence to project guidelines.
- [ ] Integration with the existing system is seamless, with comprehensive testing validation.

## Dependencies

- Access to the project's Supabase instance for real-time data subscriptions.
- Existing frontend and backend infrastructure for fetching and displaying run data.

## Implementation Notes

### Development Guidelines

- Use the latest stable versions of SvelteKit and Supabase client libraries.
- Follow the existing project structure for SvelteKit components and services.
- Implement error handling and loading states to enhance user experience.
- Adhere to ESLint and Prettier configurations for code style consistency.

### Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests:** Cover new frontend components and utility functions.
- **Integration Tests:** Test the interaction between the new view, Supabase Realtime, and backend services.
- **Manual Testing:** Perform user acceptance testing for filtering, sorting, and navigation features.

### Security Considerations

- Validate all user inputs for search and filter operations to prevent injection attacks.
- Ensure that RLS policies on Supabase are correctly enforced for multi-tenant data isolation.

### Monitoring & Observability

- Incorporate logging for key user interactions and errors within the view.
- Monitor performance metrics, focusing on load times and real-time update latency.
