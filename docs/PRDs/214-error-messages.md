# PRD: Enhancing Error Messages for MeshHook

**Issue:** [#214](https://github.com/profullstack/meshhook/issues/214)  
**Milestone:** Phase 10: Polish & Launch  
**Labels:** ux-improvements, hacktoberfest  
**Owner:** Anthony Ettinger (Profullstack)  
**License:** MIT  

## Overview

This PRD outlines the task of enhancing error messages within the MeshHook platform. The objective is to improve the clarity, specificity, and actionability of error messages across the system. This task aligns with MeshHook's goal to provide a user-friendly, robust, and secure workflow engine by ensuring that users and developers can quickly understand and resolve issues that arise during workflow creation, execution, and management.

### Objectives

- Improve user experience by making error messages more informative and less technical.
- Aid in quicker troubleshooting and resolution of issues.
- Maintain system security by ensuring error messages do not reveal sensitive information.

## Functional Requirements

1. **Enhanced Error Messaging:** Develop a standardized format for error messages that includes error code, a clear description, and actionable advice or a link to more information.
2. **Error Categorization:** Implement a system to categorize errors (e.g., Validation Errors, Execution Errors, System Errors) and handle them accordingly.
3. **Localization Readiness:** Structure error messages in a way that supports future localization efforts.
4. **User Documentation:** Update the user documentation to include a section on common errors and their troubleshooting steps.
5. **Developer Logging:** Ensure detailed error information is logged for developers, without exposing sensitive information to the end-user.

## Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** Error handling should introduce minimal overhead to system performance.
- **Security:** Ensure that error messages are designed in a way that does not expose sensitive data or system internals.
- **Reliability:** Implement robust error handling that can gracefully manage unexpected system states.
- **Maintainability:** Design the error handling mechanism to be easily extendable and maintainable.

## Technical Specifications

### Architecture Context

MeshHook uses SvelteKit for the frontend, Supabase for backend services, and Postgres for data management. The system architecture is designed around webhook triggers, a visual DAG builder, and durable, replayable runs.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Analysis & Audit:** Review existing error messages across the system for consistency and clarity. Identify common scenarios that result in errors.
2. **Standardization:** Establish a standardized error message format that includes an error code, user-friendly description, and actionable advice or link to more info.
3. **Implementation:** 
    - Update existing error messages to conform to the new standard.
    - Implement error categorization logic.
    - Securely log detailed error information for developer use.
4. **Testing:** Incorporate unit and integration tests to ensure error messages display as expected and that sensitive information is not exposed.
5. **Documentation:** Update the user and developer documentation to reflect the new error handling approach and provide guidance on common errors.

### Data Model Adjustments

No direct changes to the existing data models are required for this task. However, enhancements to logging may necessitate adjustments to logging structures to capture additional error context.

### API Endpoints Adjustments

No new API endpoints will be introduced. Existing endpoints will be evaluated to ensure that they return error information in the standardized format.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Error messages across the system conform to the new standardized format.
- [ ] Error messages are categorized, and each category has appropriate user guidance.
- [ ] Sensitive information is not exposed in user-facing error messages.
- [ ] Documentation is updated to include guidance on common errors and their resolution.
- [ ] Tests confirm error handling works as expected without introducing significant performance overhead.

## Dependencies

- Access to the MeshHook codebase for analysis and modification.
- Collaboration with the UI/UX team to ensure error message clarity and user-friendliness.
- Coordination with the documentation team for updating user and developer guides.

## Implementation Notes

### Development Guidelines

- Adhere to MeshHook's coding and documentation standards.
- Ensure new code is well-commented and follows secure coding practices.
- Utilize existing logging frameworks for developer-focused error information.

### Testing Strategy

- Implement unit tests for new error handling logic to ensure error messages conform to the standard format.
- Conduct integration tests to verify that errors are correctly categorized and handled across different system components.
- Perform manual testing in various scenarios to ensure error messages are clear, informative, and secure.

### Security Considerations

- Review all user-facing error messages to ensure they do not disclose sensitive information or system internals.
- Ensure detailed error logs are accessible only to authorized personnel.

### Monitoring & Observability

- Enhance system monitoring to track the occurrence and types of errors over time.
- Set up alerts for an abnormal increase in error rates or the emergence of new error types.

**Definition of Done:**

- The implementation is complete, with all acceptance criteria met.
- Code is reviewed, merged into the main branch, and all CI/CD checks pass.
- Documentation is updated and accurate.
- The feature is ready for production deployment.
