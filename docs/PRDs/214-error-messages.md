# PRD: Enhancing Error Messages for MeshHook

**Issue:** [#214](https://github.com/profullstack/meshhook/issues/214)  
**Milestone:** Phase 10: Polish & Launch  
**Labels:** ux-improvements, hacktoberfest  
**Owner:** Anthony Ettinger (Profullstack)  
**License:** MIT  

## Overview

<<<<<<< HEAD
This PRD outlines the task of enhancing error messages within the MeshHook platform. The objective is to improve the clarity, specificity, and actionability of error messages across the system. This task aligns with MeshHook's goal to provide a user-friendly, robust, and secure workflow engine by ensuring that users and developers can quickly understand and resolve issues that arise during workflow creation, execution, and management.

### Objectives

- Improve user experience by making error messages more informative and less technical.
- Aid in quicker troubleshooting and resolution of issues.
- Maintain system security by ensuring error messages do not reveal sensitive information.

## Functional Requirements

1. **Enhanced Error Messaging:** Develop a standardized format for error messages that includes error code, a clear description, and actionable advice or a link to more information.
2. **Error Categorization:** Implement a system to categorize errors (e.g., Validation Errors, Execution Errors, System Errors) and handle them accordingly.
3. **Localization Readiness:** Structure error messages in a way that supports future localization efforts.
4. **User Documentation:** Update the user documentation to include a section on common errors and their troubleshooting steps.
5. **Developer Logging:** Ensure detailed error information is logged for developers, without exposing sensitive information to the end-user.

## Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** Error handling should introduce minimal overhead to system performance.
- **Security:** Ensure that error messages are designed in a way that does not expose sensitive data or system internals.
- **Reliability:** Implement robust error handling that can gracefully manage unexpected system states.
- **Maintainability:** Design the error handling mechanism to be easily extendable and maintainable.
=======
This task focuses on enhancing the user experience through the refinement of error messages within the MeshHook platform. The goal is to make error messages more informative, user-friendly, and actionable, thereby aligning with MeshHook's core objectives of simplifying complex workflows and enhancing reliability and security. This improvement is crucial for end-users to efficiently troubleshoot and resolve issues, as well as for developers to maintain and debug the system more effectively.

---

## Functional Requirements

1. **Error Message Clarity:** Refine error messages to be specific, concise, and clear. Include necessary details that would help users understand the context and potential next steps.
2. **Error Categorization:** Classify errors into categories (e.g., User Errors, System Errors, Integration Errors) for better handling and user guidance.
3. **User Action Suggestions:** Where applicable, error messages should suggest next steps or actions users can take to resolve the issue.
4. **Localization Support:** Prepare error messages for future localization efforts, ensuring that messages can be easily translated without losing context.
5. **Logging:** Ensure that all errors are appropriately logged with sufficient context for debugging purposes.
6. **Documentation:** Update documentation to include common errors and troubleshooting steps.

---

## Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** Error handling processes should not significantly impact application performance.
- **Reliability:** The system should gracefully handle errors, ensuring the application remains stable.
- **Security:** Sensitive information must not be exposed through error messages.
- **Maintainability:** Error message handling should be implemented in a way that allows for easy updates and localization.

## Technical Specifications

### Architecture Context

<<<<<<< HEAD
MeshHook uses SvelteKit for the frontend, Supabase for backend services, and Postgres for data management. The system architecture is designed around webhook triggers, a visual DAG builder, and durable, replayable runs.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Analysis & Audit:** Review existing error messages across the system for consistency and clarity. Identify common scenarios that result in errors.
2. **Standardization:** Establish a standardized error message format that includes an error code, user-friendly description, and actionable advice or link to more info.
3. **Implementation:** 
    - Update existing error messages to conform to the new standard.
    - Implement error categorization logic.
    - Securely log detailed error information for developer use.
4. **Testing:** Incorporate unit and integration tests to ensure error messages display as expected and that sensitive information is not exposed.
5. **Documentation:** Update the user and developer documentation to reflect the new error handling approach and provide guidance on common errors.

### Data Model Adjustments

No direct changes to the existing data models are required for this task. However, enhancements to logging may necessitate adjustments to logging structures to capture additional error context.
=======
- SvelteKit for frontend error display and handling.
- Supabase for backend error logging and management.
- Integration points include webhook triggers, workflow execution paths, and user interface components.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Analysis:** Audit current error messages and categorize them for clarity, actionability, and user impact.
2. **Design:** Define a standard template for error messages that includes an error code, user-friendly message, and (if applicable) a link to further documentation or steps for resolution.
3. **Implementation:**
   - Revise existing error messages according to the new template.
   - Implement categorization and handling logic in both frontend (SvelteKit) and backend services.
   - Enhance logging mechanisms to capture error context more effectively.
4. **Testing:** Add tests to validate error handling and message displays across different scenarios.
5. **Documentation:** Update the project documentation to reflect changes in error handling and to include a reference for common errors and troubleshooting.

### API Endpoints Adjustments

<<<<<<< HEAD
No new API endpoints will be introduced. Existing endpoints will be evaluated to ensure that they return error information in the standardized format.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Error messages across the system conform to the new standardized format.
- [ ] Error messages are categorized, and each category has appropriate user guidance.
- [ ] Sensitive information is not exposed in user-facing error messages.
- [ ] Documentation is updated to include guidance on common errors and their resolution.
- [ ] Tests confirm error handling works as expected without introducing significant performance overhead.

## Dependencies

- Access to the MeshHook codebase for analysis and modification.
- Collaboration with the UI/UX team to ensure error message clarity and user-friendliness.
- Coordination with the documentation team for updating user and developer guides.
=======
No changes to the data model are required specifically for error message handling. However, additional logging fields or structures may be considered to enhance error context capture.

### API Endpoints

No new API endpoints are required. Existing endpoints may need adjustments to ensure error responses are consistent with the new error handling standards.
