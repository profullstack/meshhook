# PRD: Enhanced Error Messaging System

## Overview

This PRD outlines the development of an enhanced error messaging system for the MeshHook project, aligning with the overarching goals of improving user experience and system reliability. The objective is to implement a comprehensive and user-friendly error reporting mechanism that aids in debugging and provides clear, actionable feedback to users and developers.

MeshHook, as a webhook-first, deterministic, Postgres-native workflow engine, aims to deliver n8n's visual simplicity and Temporal's durability without restrictive licensing. The enhanced error messaging system is a critical component in achieving this by ensuring that errors are not just captured, but also meaningfully communicated.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

1. **Detailed Error Reporting:** Capture and report errors with detailed context to enable quick identification and resolution.
2. **User-Friendly Messages:** Transform system errors into user-friendly messages that can be easily understood by end-users without technical backgrounds.
3. **Error Localization:** Support error message localization to cater to a global user base.
4. **Error Logging:** Log errors with sufficient details (stack trace, user actions, inputs) for debugging purposes.
5. **API Error Standards:** Implement a standardized error response format for API endpoints.

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** The error handling mechanism should introduce minimal overhead to the system's response time.
- **Reliability:** The system should be capable of capturing and logging errors under all circumstances, including network failures and system crashes.
- **Security:** Ensure that error messages do not expose sensitive information that could be exploited.
- **Maintainability:** The error handling code should be modular, easy to understand, and maintain.

## Technical Specifications

### Architecture Context

MeshHook utilizes a modern tech stack including SvelteKit for SSR/API, Supabase for database and real-time functionalities, and a combination of orchestrator and HTTP executor workers for process management. The enhanced error messaging system should integrate seamlessly with these components, utilizing existing logging and monitoring setups.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Error Classification:** Define error categories (e.g., validation errors, system errors, execution errors) and map existing and new errors to these categories.
2. **Error Handling Infrastructure:** Develop a centralized error handling module that captures errors, classifies them, and decides the course of action (log, display to user, etc.).
3. **User-Friendly Messages:** Create a dictionary of error messages that are informative and non-technical. Include support for localization.
4. **Logging Enhancements:** Enhance the logging mechanism to include error categorization, severity levels, and contextual information.
5. **API Error Format:** Define a standard API error response format (including HTTP status codes, error codes, and messages) and implement it across all endpoints.

### Data Model

No immediate data model changes are required for the implementation of the enhanced error messaging system. However, a review of the current logging and error tracking mechanisms may suggest enhancements or new structures for better categorization and analysis of errors.

### API Endpoints

N/A - This task primarily focuses on internal error handling mechanisms rather than external API changes. However, standardization of error responses in existing APIs will be conducted.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Error handling module that captures and classifies errors is implemented.
- [ ] User-friendly error messages are displayed to end-users.
- [ ] Error messages support localization.
- [ ] Enhanced error logging mechanism is in place, capturing detailed error context.
- [ ] Standardized error response format for APIs is implemented and documented.
- [ ] No sensitive information is exposed in error messages.
- [ ] Performance benchmarks post-implementation match the pre-implementation benchmarks within a 5% margin.

## Dependencies

- Review of the current error handling and logging mechanisms.
- Existing project codebase and infrastructure for seamless integration.
- Localization framework or service, if localization support is not already present.

## Implementation Notes

### Development Guidelines

- Follow the existing project structure and coding standards.
- Prioritize security and privacy in error handlingâ€”avoid logging sensitive information.
- Use existing logging and monitoring services for error tracking.

### Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests:** For the error handling module and any new utility functions.
- **Integration Tests:** To ensure errors are correctly captured, logged, and displayed across different modules.
- **Manual Testing:** For user-facing error messages, ensuring clarity and appropriateness.

### Security Considerations

- Review error messages to ensure they do not leak sensitive information or hints that could be used for exploitation.
- Ensure error logging is secure and access to logs is restricted.

### Monitoring & Observability

- Enhance existing monitoring to include alerts for critical errors or unusual spikes in error rates.
- Utilize Supabase Realtime for monitoring error logs, if applicable.

## Related Documentation

- Main PRD, Architecture, and Security Guidelines documents.
- Any existing documentation on error handling and logging within the project.

By implementing this enhanced error messaging system, MeshHook will improve its usability, reliability, and maintainability, aligning with the project's goals and providing a better experience for both users and developers.
