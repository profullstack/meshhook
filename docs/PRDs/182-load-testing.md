# PRD: Load Testing for MeshHook

**Issue:** [#182](https://github.com/profullstack/meshhook/issues/182)  
**Milestone:** Phase 7: Testing  
**Labels:** performance-tests, hacktoberfest  
**Phase:** Phase 7  
**Section:** Performance Tests

---

## 1. Overview

Load testing is a critical phase in ensuring that the MeshHook platform is robust, scalable, and can handle a high volume of requests without degradation in performance or reliability. This task aims to validate the system's durability and responsiveness under various stress levels, aligning with MeshHook's goal to provide a durable, scalable, and efficient workflow engine. The results will inform optimizations and adjustments to maintain the promised performance benchmarks.

## 2. Functional Requirements

1. **Test Plan Creation:** Develop a comprehensive load testing plan that covers all critical paths of the MeshHook platform, including webhook triggers, workflow executions, live log streaming, and multi-tenant RLS security.
2. **Load Testing Tool Configuration:** Configure and prepare load testing tools (e.g., JMeter, Locust.io) tailored to simulate real-world usage patterns.
3. **Execution and Monitoring:** Execute load tests according to the plan, monitoring system performance, and identifying bottlenecks or failure points.
4. **Result Analysis:** Analyze test results to identify performance trends, bottlenecks, and areas for improvement.
5. **Optimization and Retesting:** Propose and implement optimizations based on test results, followed by retesting to evaluate the effectiveness of changes.

## 3. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** System should support concurrent processing of at least 10,000 workflows within the target sub-second response times for user-facing operations under load.
- **Reliability:** System should demonstrate 99.9% uptime, with automatic recovery from failures without human intervention during and after load testing.
- **Security:** Load testing should not expose the system to new security vulnerabilities, adhering to RLS and secrets management best practices.
- **Maintainability:** Test scripts and configurations should be easily maintainable and adjustable to accommodate future changes in the platform.

## 4. Technical Specifications

### Architecture Context

MeshHook utilizes a combination of SvelteKit for the frontend and Supabase for backend services, including Postgres, Realtime, and Storage. The system architecture supports webhook intake, workflow CRUD operations, and live log streaming, facilitated by serverless Workers for orchestration and execution.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Analysis:** Review the current architecture, focusing on components exposed to high load.
2. **Design:** Develop a load testing strategy that includes:
   - Identifying key workflows for testing.
   - Creating realistic user behavior models.
   - Selecting appropriate metrics for monitoring (e.g., response times, error rates, resource utilization).
3. **Implementation:** Set up the load testing environment using chosen tools and write test scripts based on the strategy.
4. **Execution:** Run tests, monitor system behavior, and collect performance data.
5. **Optimization:** Analyze results, identify bottlenecks, and implement optimizations. Repeat testing as necessary.

### Data Model

No direct changes to the data model are required for load testing. However, any discovered need for optimization may lead to adjustments in database schemas, indexes, or query optimizations to support higher performance.

### API Endpoints

Load testing will cover existing API endpoints, especially focusing on webhook triggers and workflow execution paths. New endpoints for testing purposes are not anticipated.

## 5. Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Load testing plan developed and documented.
- [ ] Load testing environment configured with all necessary tools and scripts.
- [ ] Load tests executed according to the plan, with performance metrics collected.
- [ ] System performance under load analyzed, with a report detailing findings, including any bottlenecks.
- [ ] Optimizations implemented based on test results, with a subsequent round of testing demonstrating improved performance.
- [ ] System maintains or exceeds target performance benchmarks under simulated peak load conditions.

## 6. Dependencies

- Access to sufficient hardware or cloud resources to simulate the desired load.
- Availability of load testing tools and expertise in configuring and using them.
- Collaboration with the development team for potential quick fixes or optimizations.

## 7. Implementation Notes

### Development Guidelines

- Maintain documentation for test configurations and results to ensure reproducibility.
- Follow best practices for secure, efficient code in any scripts or tools developed for testing purposes.

### Testing Strategy

- Combine automated load testing tools with manual testing for critical, user-facing workflows.
- Use a phased testing approach, starting with lower loads and gradually increasing to the target peak load.

### Security Considerations

- Ensure testing does not compromise the security of the system or expose sensitive data.
- Use isolated environments or masked data to prevent any impact on production systems or data.

### Monitoring & Observability

- Utilize Supabase Realtime and other monitoring tools to observe system behavior under load.
- Set up detailed logging for error tracking and performance metrics collection.

By adhering to this PRD, MeshHook aims to ensure its platform remains performant, reliable, and scalable, meeting the high standards required by its users.
