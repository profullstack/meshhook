# PRD: Architecture Deep-Dive

**Issue:** [#191](https://github.com/profullstack/meshhook/issues/191)  
**Milestone:** Phase 8: Documentation  
**Labels:** developer-documentation, hacktoberfest  
**Owner:** Anthony Ettinger (Profullstack)  
**License:** MIT  

## Overview

The Architecture Deep-Dive is a critical documentation effort under the Developer Documentation section, aimed at providing a comprehensive, technical insight into the MeshHook project's architecture. This task aligns with Phase 8 of the project and is crucial for enabling developers to understand, contribute to, and extend the MeshHook workflow engine, which leverages the simplicity of n8n and the durability of Temporal, within a Postgres-native, webhook-first design.

### Objectives

- To detail the architectural choices, components, and their interactions within the MeshHook project.
- To align the documentation with MeshHook's core functionalities, including webhook triggers, visual DAG builder, durable runs, live logs, and multi-tenant security.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

1. **Complete Architectural Overview:** Provide a detailed description of MeshHook's architecture, including its components, data flow, and interaction patterns.
2. **Component-Specific Details:** Break down each major component (SvelteKit, Supabase, Workers) and describe its role, configuration, and integration points within the system.
3. **Data Model and Event Sourcing:** Describe the event sourcing model, including the structure of events, how they are captured, stored, and replayed.
4. **Security Architecture:** Detail the security mechanisms in place, including RLS, secrets management, webhook verification, and audit logging.

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** Documentation must include performance considerations and optimizations at the architecture level.
- **Reliability:** Highlight the architectural decisions that contribute to the system's reliability and fault tolerance.
- **Security:** Provide in-depth details of security practices, including data encryption, RLS, and secrets handling.
- **Maintainability:** Ensure that the architecture is documented in a way that supports easy maintenance and extension of the platform.

## Technical Specifications

### Architecture Context

MeshHook is built on a robust stack combining SvelteKit, Supabase, and worker-based processing to offer a scalable, durable, and secure workflow engine. The architecture is designed to support webhook triggers, complex workflow executions, event sourcing for durability, and live monitoring through Supabase Realtime, all within a multi-tenant environment secured by RLS.

#### Integration Points

1. **SvelteKit (SSR/API):** Handles frontend rendering and API endpoints for CRUD operations, webhook intake, and run consoles.
2. **Supabase:** Utilizes Postgres for data storage and queues, Realtime for log streaming, Storage for artifacts, and Edge for cron/timer-based triggers.
3. **Workers:** Comprises an Orchestrator for state management and scheduling, and an HTTP Executor for handling HTTP requests with robust retry/backoff mechanisms.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Architecture Review:** Begin with a thorough review of the existing architecture diagrams and documentation.
2. **Component Analysis:** Dive into each main component, documenting the setup, purpose, and how it integrates with other parts of the system.
3. **Security and Reliability:** Focus on the security measures in place and the architectural patterns ensuring system reliability.
4. **Performance Considerations:** Document architecture-related performance considerations and best practices implemented in MeshHook.

### Data Model

Refer to `./diagrams/data_model.puml` for the current data model. Highlight how the data model supports event sourcing, including tables for storing webhook events, workflow states, and execution logs.

### API Endpoints

No new API endpoints are introduced in this task. However, the documentation will cover existing endpoints crucial for workflow operations, including webhook intake and management endpoints for workflows and runs.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Architectural overview accurately reflects the current state of the MeshHook project.
- [ ] Component-specific details are clear, accurate, and provide developers with a deep understanding of each component's role.
- [ ] Security architecture is thoroughly documented, including all aspects of RLS, secrets management, and audit logging.
- [ ] Performance, reliability, and maintainability considerations are well-documented.
- [ ] Documentation follows project conventions and is integrated into the existing developer documentation structure.

## Dependencies

- Access to the current architecture diagrams and documentation.
- Consultation with the development team for insights into recent architectural changes or updates.

## Implementation Notes

### Development Guidelines

- Use Markdown for documentation to ensure compatibility with GitHub and other MD viewers.
- Follow the existing documentation structure to maintain consistency.

### Testing Strategy

- Peer reviews by the development team and stakeholders to validate the accuracy and completeness of the architectural documentation.
- Validate links, diagrams, and code snippets within the documentation to ensure they are correct and functional.

### Security Considerations

- Ensure that all described security mechanisms (RLS, secrets management, etc.) are up-to-date with current implementations.
- Avoid disclosing sensitive information or specifics that could compromise the security posture of MeshHook.

### Monitoring & Observability

- Include a section on how monitoring and observability are integrated into the architecture, focusing on Supabase Realtime and any custom metrics or logging solutions employed.
