# PRD: Architecture Deep-Dive Documentation

**Issue:** [#191](https://github.com/profullstack/meshhook/issues/191)  
**Milestone:** Phase 8: Documentation  
**Labels:** developer-documentation, hacktoberfest  
**Owner:** Anthony Ettinger (Profullstack)  
**License:** MIT  

## Overview

The MeshHook project, a webhook-first, deterministic, Postgres-native workflow engine, aims to combine the visual simplicity of n8n with the durability of Temporal, all under a permissive MIT license. This task focuses on creating a deep-dive architectural documentation designed to provide developers with an in-depth understanding of MeshHook's internal workings, design rationale, and technical specifications. It aligns with the project's goals by facilitating developer onboarding, contributing, and extending the MeshHook ecosystem.

### Objectives

- Produce a comprehensive architectural guide covering all aspects of MeshHook's design and operation.
- Facilitate developer understanding and contributions by detailing the interaction between components, data flows, and security measures.
- Ensure the documentation reflects the project's current state, including recent updates and future directions.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

1. **Architectural Overview:** A complete, detailed description of MeshHook's architecture, including an explanation of the system's components, their interactions, and data flows.
   
2. **Component-Specific Documentation:** Detailed breakdowns of each major system component (e.g., SvelteKit, Supabase, Worker Processes), including their roles, configurations, and how they integrate with the rest of the system.
   
3. **Data Models and Event Sourcing:** An in-depth look at the event sourcing mechanism, detailing the event model, storage, and replayability features.
   
4. **Security Measures:** Comprehensive documentation of MeshHook's security features, including Row-Level Security (RLS), secrets management, webhook signature verification, and audit trails.

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** The documentation should include an analysis of MeshHook's performance characteristics and the architectural choices made to ensure scalability and efficiency.
  
- **Reliability:** Highlight the architectural features that ensure MeshHook's reliability, including fault tolerance mechanisms and data durability strategies.
  
- **Security:** Detailed explanation of the security model, including data encryption, authentication, and authorization mechanisms.
  
- **Maintainability:** The architecture should be documented in a way that supports easy future modifications, scalability, and understanding by new developers.

## Technical Specifications

### Architecture Context

MeshHook leverages a combination of SvelteKit for frontend operations and API handling, Supabase for real-time data updates and Postgres-based storage, and a worker-based architecture for background processing. This setup ensures scalability, security, and efficient data handling, supporting features such as webhook triggers, visual DAG building, and live log updates.

#### Integration Points

- **SvelteKit:** Manages the user interface and serves as the gateway for API requests, including webhook receipts and workflow management.
- **Supabase:** Provides real-time database updates, user authentication, and storage services, integrated closely with MeshHook's event sourcing and logging mechanisms.
- **Worker Processes:** Handle asynchronous tasks such as executing webhook-triggered workflows, ensuring scalability and reliability of the processing pipeline.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Component Analysis and Documentation:** Start with each major component, documenting its purpose, configuration, and interactions with other parts of the system.
   
2. **Data Model Explanation:** Using the existing `data_model.puml` as a base, explain how the data model supports MeshHook's functionality, especially focusing on event sourcing and multi-tenancy.
   
3. **Security Framework:** Detail the implementation of security measures, justifying the choices made and explaining how they protect data and ensure compliance.

### Data Model

The documentation will include a detailed explanation of the data model, focusing on how it supports event sourcing, multi-tenancy, and security. This will involve describing the schemas, relationships, and any special considerations for data integrity and access control.

### API Endpoints

While this task does not introduce new API endpoints, it will document existing endpoints crucial for MeshHook's operation, including their roles, request/response formats, and security considerations.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] The architectural documentation provides a clear, comprehensive overview of MeshHook's design and operational mechanics.
- [ ] Developers can understand the role and configuration of each component within the system.
- [ ] Security measures are thoroughly documented, with explanations of how data integrity, confidentiality, and compliance are maintained.
- [ ] Performance and reliability considerations are clearly articulated, with examples of how the architecture supports these objectives.

## Dependencies

- Access to the latest architecture diagrams and documentation.
- Technical insights and clarifications from the core development team.

## Implementation Notes

### Development Guidelines

- Utilize Markdown for all documentation to ensure accessibility and compatibility.
- Adhere to the existing documentation structure and style guide to maintain consistency across the project's documentation resources.

### Testing Strategy

- Conduct peer reviews with the development team and subject matter experts to validate the accuracy and completeness of the documentation.
- Test all documented code snippets and API calls to ensure they work as described.

### Security Considerations

- Verify that the documentation accurately reflects the current security implementations and does not inadvertently expose sensitive information or vulnerabilities.
- Update the security section to reflect any recent changes in MeshHook's security posture or strategy.

### Monitoring & Observability

- Document how monitoring and observability are baked into MeshHook's architecture, including the use of Supabase Realtime for log streaming and the integration of any external monitoring tools or practices.

This PRD aims to lay a solid foundation for MeshHook's ongoing development and ensure that the project remains accessible, understandable, and extensible for developers.
