# PRD: Key Rotation Mechanism

**Issue:** [#146](https://github.com/profullstack/meshhook/issues/146)  
**Milestone:** Phase 4: Security  
**Labels:** secrets-encryption  
**Phase:** Phase 4  
**Section:** Secrets Encryption  

## Overview

The introduction of a key rotation mechanism is a critical security enhancement for the MeshHook project. This task focuses on developing a system to periodically update the encryption keys used for securing secrets within the project's secret vault. The primary goal is to enhance the security posture of MeshHook by minimizing the risks associated with key compromise. This mechanism aligns with MeshHook's commitment to providing robust, multi-tenant RLS security and adheres to best practices in secrets management.

## Functional Requirements

1. **Key Rotation Logic:** Implement logic for rotating encryption keys used in secrets encryption. This includes generating new keys and transitioning the secrets to use the newly generated keys.
2. **Backward Compatibility:** Ensure the key rotation mechanism supports decrypting secrets encrypted with old keys to maintain access to historical data.
3. **Automatic Rotation Schedule:** Implement a configurable schedule for automatic key rotation, allowing system administrators to define rotation frequency.
4. **Manual Rotation Trigger:** Provide an interface (CLI/API) for manually triggering a key rotation, in addition to the automatic schedule.
5. **Key Versioning:** Maintain a versioning system for encryption keys to track and manage the use of current and previous keys.
6. **Key Rotation Audit:** Log all key rotation activities, including the initiation of a rotation, completion, and any errors encountered during the process.

## Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** Ensure the key rotation process does not significantly impact system performance or availability.
- **Reliability:** Design the rotation mechanism to handle failures gracefully, with the ability to retry or rollback in case of errors.
- **Security:** Use secure cryptographic practices for generating, storing, and handling encryption keys. Ensure all key rotation operations are authorized and authenticated.
- **Maintainability:** Write clear, well-documented, and modular code to facilitate future updates and maintenance.

## Technical Specifications

### Architecture Context

MeshHook utilizes SvelteKit for its front-end and Supabase for backend services, including Postgres for data storage. The key rotation mechanism must integrate seamlessly with this existing architecture, particularly focusing on the secure handling and storage of encryption keys within Postgres.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Analysis:** Conduct a thorough review of the current encryption and secrets management implementation to identify the best integration points for the key rotation mechanism.
2. **Design:**
   - Define a new schema for storing encryption keys with versioning information in Postgres.
   - Outline the process for migrating existing secrets to use new keys.
   - Draft the logic for automatic and manual key rotation triggers.
3. **Implementation:**
   - Develop the key rotation logic, including new key generation, secrets re-encryption, and version management.
   - Implement the scheduling system for automatic rotations and API/CLI endpoints for manual triggers.
   - Create audit logging for all key rotation activities.
4. **Integration:** Ensure the new mechanism works in harmony with the existing secrets encryption and storage workflows.
5. **Testing:** Perform comprehensive testing, including unit, integration, and end-to-end tests, to validate functionality and reliability.
6. **Documentation:** Update the project documentation to include details on the key rotation mechanism, configuration options, and operational procedures.

### Data Model Changes

- **EncryptionKeys Table:** A new table to store encryption keys with fields for key ID, version, creation date, and an indicator of whether it's the active key.

### API Endpoints

- **POST /api/keys/rotate:** Triggers a manual key rotation. Requires administrative privileges.
  
## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Key rotation logic correctly generates new keys and re-encrypts secrets.
- [ ] Automatic and manual rotation mechanisms are fully operational.
- [ ] Key versioning system effectively tracks and manages multiple key versions.
- [ ] Key rotation activities are accurately logged for audit purposes.
- [ ] No significant performance degradation during or after key rotations.
- [ ] Documentation accurately reflects the key rotation feature and its usage.
- [ ] All security considerations are adequately addressed.

## Dependencies

- Access to the project's Supabase instance for schema modifications and integration testing.
- Existing encryption and secrets management code for integration points analysis.

## Implementation Notes

### Development Guidelines

- Follow modern JavaScript best practices and the existing project's coding standards.
- Utilize secure cryptographic libraries recommended for key generation and management.
- Ensure all new code is thoroughly covered with automated tests.

### Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests:** For key rotation logic, version management, and scheduling.
- **Integration Tests:** To verify the interaction between the key rotation mechanism and secrets encryption/storage.
- **Manual Testing:** For the manual rotation trigger and audit log verification.

### Security Considerations

- Ensure all cryptographic operations use secure algorithms and libraries.
- Restrict key rotation operations to authorized users only.
- Securely manage old keys, ensuring they are accessible for decrypting historical data but protected from unauthorized use.

### Monitoring & Observability

- Implement monitoring for the key rotation process to track its success, duration, and any failures.
- Enhance existing logging to include key rotation activities for audit and troubleshooting purposes.

## Related Documentation

- Updated schema definitions in `schema.sql` reflecting the new EncryptionKeys table.
- API documentation to include details on the new /api/keys/rotate endpoint.
- Operational documentation on configuring automatic key rotation schedules and performing manual rotations.
