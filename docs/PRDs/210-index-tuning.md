# PRD: Index Tuning for MeshHook

**Issue:** [#210](https://github.com/profullstack/meshhook/issues/210)  
**Milestone:** Phase 10: Polish & Launch  
**Labels:** performance-optimization, hacktoberfest  
**Owner:** Anthony Ettinger  
**License:** MIT  

## Overview

The objective of this task is to optimize the database indices within MeshHook, ensuring high performance and efficient data retrieval as we scale. This task aligns with our overarching goal to create a deterministic, Postgres-native workflow engine that is both robust and easy to scale. Index tuning is crucial for maintaining sub-second response times for user-facing operations, especially as the amount and complexity of workflows increase.

## Functional Requirements

1. **Index Analysis:** Conduct a comprehensive analysis of the current database schema to identify potential areas for optimization, focusing on frequently accessed tables and queries.
2. **Index Optimization:** Implement new indices or modify existing ones based on the analysis to improve query performance.
3. **Benchmarking:** Before and after benchmarking to quantify the performance improvements.
4. **Documentation:** Update the database schema documentation to reflect any changes made during the index tuning process.

## Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** Ensure that the optimizations lead to measurable improvements in query execution time and overall application responsiveness.
- **Reliability:** Maintain or improve the current level of database stability and reliability post-optimization.
- **Security:** Ensure that any changes do not negatively impact the security posture of the application.
- **Maintainability:** The index changes should be maintainable and documented clearly for future reference.

## Technical Specifications

### Architecture Context

MeshHook leverages **Supabase** for its Postgres database, which includes data storage for workflow definitions, runs, events, and secrets. Given this architecture, index tuning must consider the unique aspects of Supabase's managed Postgres service, such as any limitations on index types or sizes.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Analysis:**
   - Use Postgres' `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` on frequently executed queries to identify slow or inefficient query plans.
   - Review query patterns in critical paths, such as webhook processing, workflow execution, and live log streaming.
2. **Design:**
   - Determine which indices to add, remove, or modify based on the analysis.
   - Consider partial indices for frequently filtered columns and multi-column indices for queries involving multiple criteria.
3. **Implementation:**
   - Apply index changes in a development environment.
   - Conduct before and after benchmarking to validate performance improvements.
4. **Integration:**
   - Ensure no adverse effects on existing functionalities.
   - Validate that the application's security and multi-tenancy features are unaffected.
5. **Testing:**
   - Perform comprehensive testing, including regression, performance, and load testing.
6. **Documentation:**
   - Update the `schema.sql` file and any relevant documentation to reflect the index changes.
7. **Review:**
   - Conduct a thorough code and architecture review with the team, focusing on the potential long-term impacts of the index changes.

### Data Model

No new data models are introduced. Changes will be focused on the modification of existing database indices.

### API Endpoints

N/A

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Database index analysis report completed.
- [ ] Index optimizations implemented and documented.
- [ ] Performance benchmarks show a significant improvement in query execution times.
- [ ] All existing functionalities are verified to work as expected post-optimization.
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved by the development team.
- [ ] Documentation updated to reflect the index changes.

## Dependencies

- Access to the Supabase project and Postgres database.
- Existing database schema and query logs for analysis.

## Implementation Notes

### Development Guidelines

- Ensure all changes are backward compatible with existing data and functionalities.
- Follow the established coding standards and best practices for database management and optimization.

### Testing Strategy

- Automated regression tests to ensure existing functionalities are not impacted.
- Performance tests to compare query execution times before and after the optimizations.

### Security Considerations

- Verify that index changes do not expose any new security vulnerabilities.
- Ensure that RLS policies and other security mechanisms remain effective.

### Monitoring & Observability

- Monitor the database performance closely after implementing the changes, focusing on query execution times and resource utilization.
- Utilize Supabase's monitoring tools to track the impact of index tuning in real-time.
