# PRD: Index Tuning for MeshHook Performance Optimization

## Overview

This PRD outlines the objectives, requirements, and implementation details for task #210: Index Tuning, under the Performance Optimization milestone of MeshHook. The primary goal of this task is to optimize the Postgres database indexes to enhance query performance, ensuring MeshHook remains efficient, responsive, and scalable as it approaches its launch phase. This task is critical for maintaining the high-performance benchmarks set by MeshHook, aligning with its core features such as webhook triggers, visual DAG builders, durable runs, and multi-tenant security.

### Purpose

The purpose of this index tuning task is to identify and alleviate database bottlenecks by optimizing indexes. This will directly contribute to MeshHook's capability to deliver sub-second response times for user-facing operations, even under increased load, thereby ensuring a seamless user experience.

### Alignment with Project Goals

This task aligns with MeshHook's goals by:

- Enhancing performance and scalability, crucial for webhook processing and workflow executions.
- Supporting the deterministic and replayable nature of runs, by ensuring data queries remain efficient as data volume grows.
- Maintaining the security and multi-tenancy model through careful consideration of index impacts on RLS.

## Functional Requirements

1. **Bottleneck Identification:** Utilize query analysis tools (e.g., `EXPLAIN`, `ANALYZE`) to pinpoint slow queries that could benefit from index optimization.
2. **Index Optimization Plan:** Develop a plan for creating new indexes or modifying existing ones to improve query performance, taking care to avoid negatively impacting write performance or data integrity.
3. **Implementation and Testing:** Implement the index changes in a controlled environment, followed by thorough testing to validate performance improvements and the absence of adverse effects.
4. **Documentation and Rollout:** Document the changes made, including the rationale for each index addition or modification, and prepare for a phased rollout with clear rollback procedures.

## Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** Demonstrate measurable improvements in query execution times while ensuring no significant degradation in write performance.
- **Reliability:** Index changes must not compromise database integrity or the deterministic behavior of workflow executions.
- **Security:** Index tuning must be performed in accordance with MeshHook's security model, preserving data isolation and protection.
- **Maintainability:** The database schema, including indexes, should remain manageable and understandable.

# PRD: Index Tuning for MeshHook

**Issue:** [#210: Index Tuning](https://github.com/profullstack/meshhook/issues/210)  
**Milestone:** Phase 10: Polish & Launch  
**Labels:** performance-optimization, hacktoberfest  
**Owner:** Anthony Ettinger  
**License:** MIT  

## Overview

As MeshHook approaches its launch phase, performance optimization becomes paramount to ensure the system can handle the expected load with efficiency and speed. Index tuning is identified as a critical task to enhance MeshHook's performance, particularly in reducing query times and improving the overall responsiveness of the system. This task aligns with MeshHook's goal of delivering a high-performance, webhook-first, deterministic, Postgres-native workflow engine.

### Objectives

- Optimize database indexes to improve query performance.
- Ensure seamless integration with MeshHook's existing Postgres-native architecture.
- Maintain or enhance the current performance benchmarks (sub-second response times for user-facing operations).

## Functional Requirements

1. **Index Analysis:** Analyze current database queries to identify bottlenecks and areas where index optimization could have the most significant impact.
2. **Index Design:** Design and propose new indexes or modifications to existing indexes to improve performance without significantly increasing storage requirements or write latency.
3. **Implementation:** Implement the proposed index changes in the development environment and measure performance improvements.
4. **Monitoring:** Establish baseline performance metrics for before and after index tuning.

## Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** Achieve a measurable improvement in query execution times without adversely affecting write operations.
- **Reliability:** Ensure the database maintains high reliability and integrity post-index optimizations.
- **Maintainability:** Keep the database schema manageable and ensure that new indexes do not introduce excessive complexity.
- **Security:** Ensure all index tuning efforts adhere to MeshHook's security guidelines, including RLS policies.

## Technical Specifications

### Architecture Context

<<<<<<< HEAD
MeshHook employs a Postgres database managed by Supabase, leveraging features like Realtime subscriptions and Row-Level Security (RLS). The index tuning must consider the existing schema, focusing on frequently accessed or queried tables, particularly those involved in webhook processing, workflow execution states, and log streaming.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Pre-analysis:** Audit current queries using `EXPLAIN` and `ANALYZE`, focusing on those critical to webhook processing and workflow executions.
2. **Index Planning:** Identify potential indexes that could improve performance, considering column selectivity and query patterns. Avoid over-indexing to prevent write performance degradation.
3. **Development Environment Testing:** Implement proposed indexes in a development environment resembling production as closely as possible. Benchmark query performance before and after index changes.
4. **Rollout Strategy:** Prepare for a phased rollout, starting with a staging environment. Monitor performance and revert if necessary.

### Data Model

No direct changes to the data model are anticipated. Index additions or modifications will be documented alongside the current schema for clarity and future reference.
=======
MeshHook utilizes a Postgres database managed by Supabase, benefiting from its capabilities like Realtime subscriptions and RLS. The index tuning task must consider the existing database schema, focusing on tables that are frequently accessed or queried by the system.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Preparation:** Set up a development environment mirroring the production setup as closely as possible.
2. **Analysis:**
   - Use `EXPLAIN` and `ANALYZE` on critical queries to identify slow operations.
   - Identify frequently accessed tables and columns without indexes.
3. **Design:** Propose new indexes or adjustments to existing ones, considering factors like column selectivity and query patterns.
4. **Implementation:** Apply index changes in the development environment.
5. **Testing:** Compare performance metrics (e.g., execution time, page reads) before and after applying index changes.
6. **Rollout:** Plan for a phased rollout of index changes to production, including monitoring and rollback plans.

### Data Model

No changes to the data model are expected solely for index tuning. However, documentation of any index additions or alterations will be required.
