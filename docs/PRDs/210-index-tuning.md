# PRD: Index Tuning for MeshHook

**Issue:** [#210: Index Tuning](https://github.com/profullstack/meshhook/issues/210)  
**Milestone:** Phase 10: Polish & Launch  
**Labels:** performance-optimization, hacktoberfest  
**Owner:** Anthony Ettinger  
**License:** MIT  

## Overview

As MeshHook approaches its launch phase, performance optimization becomes paramount to ensure the system can handle the expected load with efficiency and speed. Index tuning is identified as a critical task to enhance MeshHook's performance, particularly in reducing query times and improving the overall responsiveness of the system. This task aligns with MeshHook's goal of delivering a high-performance, webhook-first, deterministic, Postgres-native workflow engine.

### Objectives

- Optimize database indexes to improve query performance.
- Ensure seamless integration with MeshHook's existing Postgres-native architecture.
- Maintain or enhance the current performance benchmarks (sub-second response times for user-facing operations).

## Functional Requirements

1. **Index Analysis:** Analyze current database queries to identify bottlenecks and areas where index optimization could have the most significant impact.
2. **Index Design:** Design and propose new indexes or modifications to existing indexes to improve performance without significantly increasing storage requirements or write latency.
3. **Implementation:** Implement the proposed index changes in the development environment and measure performance improvements.
4. **Monitoring:** Establish baseline performance metrics for before and after index tuning.

## Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** Achieve a measurable improvement in query execution times without adversely affecting write operations.
- **Reliability:** Ensure the database maintains high reliability and integrity post-index optimizations.
- **Maintainability:** Keep the database schema manageable and ensure that new indexes do not introduce excessive complexity.
- **Security:** Ensure all index tuning efforts adhere to MeshHook's security guidelines, including RLS policies.

## Technical Specifications

### Architecture Context

MeshHook utilizes a Postgres database managed by Supabase, benefiting from its capabilities like Realtime subscriptions and RLS. The index tuning task must consider the existing database schema, focusing on tables that are frequently accessed or queried by the system.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Preparation:** Set up a development environment mirroring the production setup as closely as possible.
2. **Analysis:**
   - Use `EXPLAIN` and `ANALYZE` on critical queries to identify slow operations.
   - Identify frequently accessed tables and columns without indexes.
3. **Design:** Propose new indexes or adjustments to existing ones, considering factors like column selectivity and query patterns.
4. **Implementation:** Apply index changes in the development environment.
5. **Testing:** Compare performance metrics (e.g., execution time, page reads) before and after applying index changes.
6. **Rollout:** Plan for a phased rollout of index changes to production, including monitoring and rollback plans.

### Data Model

No changes to the data model are expected solely for index tuning. However, documentation of any index additions or alterations will be required.

### API Endpoints

N/A for this task.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Performance metrics demonstrate a measurable improvement in query times for optimized operations.
- [ ] No significant increase in database write latency or storage requirements due to new indexes.
- [ ] All modified or new indexes are documented in the project's schema documentation.
- [ ] The system maintains or improves its error rate and uptime metrics post-optimization.
- [ ] Code and changes are reviewed and approved by the MeshHook development team.

## Dependencies and Prerequisites

- Access to the production-like environment for performance testing.
- Comprehensive list of critical queries and operations for analysis.

## Implementation Notes

### Development Guidelines

- Follow the SQL style guide and naming conventions for indexes.
- Document each step of the analysis and decision-making process.
- Use version control for all changes to enable easy rollbacks.

### Testing Strategy

- Utilize both synthetic benchmarks and real-world workload simulations to test performance improvements.
- Monitor for any potential regressions in related areas of the system.

### Security Considerations

- Ensure that index tuning does not inadvertently expose data or violate RLS policies.
- Review the impact of index changes on query plans, especially for tenant-isolated queries.

### Monitoring & Observability

- Extend existing monitoring to track the performance of optimized queries.
- Set up alerts for any significant deviations in query performance metrics.
