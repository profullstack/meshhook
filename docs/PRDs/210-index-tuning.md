# PRD: Index Tuning for MeshHook Performance Optimization

## Overview

This PRD outlines the objectives, requirements, and implementation details for task #210: Index Tuning, under the Performance Optimization milestone of MeshHook. The primary goal of this task is to optimize the Postgres database indexes to enhance query performance, ensuring MeshHook remains efficient, responsive, and scalable as it approaches its launch phase. This task is critical for maintaining the high-performance benchmarks set by MeshHook, aligning with its core features such as webhook triggers, visual DAG builders, durable runs, and multi-tenant security.

### Purpose

The purpose of this index tuning task is to identify and alleviate database bottlenecks by optimizing indexes. This will directly contribute to MeshHook's capability to deliver sub-second response times for user-facing operations, even under increased load, thereby ensuring a seamless user experience.

### Alignment with Project Goals

This task aligns with MeshHook's goals by:

- Enhancing performance and scalability, crucial for webhook processing and workflow executions.
- Supporting the deterministic and replayable nature of runs, by ensuring data queries remain efficient as data volume grows.
- Maintaining the security and multi-tenancy model through careful consideration of index impacts on RLS.

## Functional Requirements

1. **Bottleneck Identification:** Utilize query analysis tools (e.g., `EXPLAIN`, `ANALYZE`) to pinpoint slow queries that could benefit from index optimization.
2. **Index Optimization Plan:** Develop a plan for creating new indexes or modifying existing ones to improve query performance, taking care to avoid negatively impacting write performance or data integrity.
3. **Implementation and Testing:** Implement the index changes in a controlled environment, followed by thorough testing to validate performance improvements and the absence of adverse effects.
4. **Documentation and Rollout:** Document the changes made, including the rationale for each index addition or modification, and prepare for a phased rollout with clear rollback procedures.

## Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** Demonstrate measurable improvements in query execution times while ensuring no significant degradation in write performance.
- **Reliability:** Index changes must not compromise database integrity or the deterministic behavior of workflow executions.
- **Security:** Index tuning must be performed in accordance with MeshHook's security model, preserving data isolation and protection.
- **Maintainability:** The database schema, including indexes, should remain manageable and understandable.

## Technical Specifications

### Architecture Context

MeshHook employs a Postgres database managed by Supabase, leveraging features like Realtime subscriptions and Row-Level Security (RLS). The index tuning must consider the existing schema, focusing on frequently accessed or queried tables, particularly those involved in webhook processing, workflow execution states, and log streaming.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Pre-analysis:** Audit current queries using `EXPLAIN` and `ANALYZE`, focusing on those critical to webhook processing and workflow executions.
2. **Index Planning:** Identify potential indexes that could improve performance, considering column selectivity and query patterns. Avoid over-indexing to prevent write performance degradation.
3. **Development Environment Testing:** Implement proposed indexes in a development environment resembling production as closely as possible. Benchmark query performance before and after index changes.
4. **Rollout Strategy:** Prepare for a phased rollout, starting with a staging environment. Monitor performance and revert if necessary.

### Data Model

No direct changes to the data model are anticipated. Index additions or modifications will be documented alongside the current schema for clarity and future reference.

### API Endpoints

N/A for this task.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Query performance improvement verified through benchmarks, with specific targets met or exceeded (e.g., 20% reduction in average query time).
- [ ] No significant increase in write latency or database resource consumption.
- [ ] Documentation updated to reflect index changes, including rationale and expected impact.
- [ ] Successful phased rollout with no critical issues reported.
- [ ] Approval from the MeshHook development team following a code and architecture review.

## Dependencies and Prerequisites

- Access to a production-like environment for accurate performance benchmarking.
- A comprehensive set of queries and operations that are essential for MeshHook's performance evaluation.
- Existing database schema and index documentation for reference.

## Implementation Notes

### Development Guidelines

- Adhere to Postgres best practices for index creation, considering index types (e.g., B-tree, GIN, GiST) appropriate for each use case.
- Document each step, including query performance benchmarks and any observed impact on database resources.
- Use version control for all changes, ensuring a clear history and straightforward rollback if needed.

### Testing Strategy

- Perform both micro-benchmarks (specific queries) and macro-benchmarks (end-to-end workflow runs) to evaluate performance improvements.
- Monitor for regression in related areas, particularly write operations and overall system responsiveness.

### Security Considerations

- Review the impact of index changes on RLS policies and data access patterns, ensuring no security regressions.
- Confirm that the optimization process does not expose sensitive information or alter data isolation guarantees.

### Monitoring & Observability

- Enhance existing monitoring tools to include performance metrics for newly optimized queries.
- Establish alerts for significant deviations from expected query performance, facilitating rapid response to any issues post-rollout.

## Related Documentation

- Database Schema Documentation: For reference to current indexes and schema design considerations.
- MeshHook Performance Benchmarks: Establish baseline performance metrics for comparison.
- Security Guidelines: Ensure compliance with MeshHook's security standards throughout the index tuning process.
