## Overview

Queue health monitoring is essential for ensuring the reliability and efficiency of MeshHook's processing capabilities. This task aims to implement a robust monitoring system for our Postgres-based durable queues, which are pivotal for managing webhook events and workflow executions. This system will align with MeshHook's goals of providing a highly available, secure, and user-friendly workflow engine by enabling proactive identification and resolution of queue-related issues.

**Objectives:**

- Implement a queue health monitoring system.
- Provide real-time visibility into queue status, including metrics such as queue length, processing time, and error rates.
- Enable alerting for critical conditions, such as queue backlogs or processing delays.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

1. **Monitoring Integration:** Integrate with Supabase Realtime for monitoring queue metrics.
2. **Alerting Mechanism:** Develop an alerting mechanism for abnormal queue conditions (e.g., length exceeds threshold, processing delays).
3. **Dashboard:** Implement a dashboard for real-time queue health visualization accessible by the MeshHook team.
4. **Documentation:** Document the monitoring and alerting setup, including how to configure thresholds and alerts.

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** Ensure minimal performance impact due to monitoring overhead.
- **Reliability:** Achieve 99.9% uptime for the monitoring system.
- **Security:** Ensure that monitoring data is secured and RLS policies are enforced.
- **Maintainability:** Code should be clean, well-documented, and adhere to MeshHook's coding standards.

## Technical Specifications

### Architecture Context

MeshHook uses **pg-boss** or **pgmq** for its queue management, with Supabase providing Postgres, Realtime, and other services. The queue health monitoring system needs to integrate seamlessly with these existing components without impacting their performance.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Analysis:** Examine the current queue setup and identify key metrics for monitoring.
2. **Design:** 
   - Determine the necessary Supabase Realtime subscriptions for queue metrics.
   - Design the alerting logic and thresholds.
   - Sketch the dashboard UI for visualizing queue health.
3. **Implementation:** 
   - Set up Supabase Realtime subscriptions for queue metrics.
   - Implement the alerting mechanism using Supabase functions or external services like AWS Lambda.
   - Develop the dashboard using SvelteKit, integrating with the existing MeshHook UI.
4. **Testing:** Perform comprehensive testing, including load testing to assess the monitoring system's impact on overall performance.
5. **Deployment:** Deploy the monitoring system in a staging environment, followed by production after successful validation.

### Data Model

No new data model changes are required for this task. Metrics can be derived from existing queue tables and logs.

### API Endpoints

No new API endpoints are required for this task. Existing Supabase Realtime and internal APIs will be used.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Queue health monitoring system integrated and operational.
- [ ] Real-time dashboard for queue metrics is accessible and functional.
- [ ] Alerting mechanism is tested and capable of notifying the team about abnormal queue states.
- [ ] All components adhere to MeshHook's performance, reliability, and security standards.
- [ ] Documentation for the monitoring system is complete and accessible.

## Dependencies

- Access to Supabase project and services (Realtime, Postgres).
- Existing queue setup using **pg-boss** or **pgmq**.

## Implementation Notes

### Development Guidelines

- Follow MeshHook's existing practices for using SvelteKit and Supabase.
- Emphasize clean, maintainable code with comprehensive inline documentation.
- Prioritize security and performance in all aspects of the implementation.

### Testing Strategy

- Implement unit and integration tests covering new functionalities.
- Conduct load testing to evaluate the monitoring system's impact on queue performance.

### Security Considerations

- Ensure that dashboard access is restricted based on `project_id` and user roles.
- Secure the alerting mechanism against unauthorized access or tampering.

### Monitoring & Observability

- Leverage Supabase Realtime for monitoring queue metrics.
- Set up logging for the monitoring system itself, to track its health and performance.
