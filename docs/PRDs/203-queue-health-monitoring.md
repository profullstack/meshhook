## Overview

<<<<<<< HEAD
Queue health monitoring is a critical aspect of ensuring the reliability and efficiency of MeshHook's processing capabilities. As MeshHook aims to deliver a webhook-first, deterministic, Postgres-native workflow engine, it's imperative that the system maintains high availability and performance. This task focuses on implementing a robust monitoring system for our Postgres-based durable queues, which manage webhook events and workflow executions. By providing real-time visibility into queue status and enabling proactive issue resolution, this feature will support MeshHook's core objectives.

## Objectives

- Implement a queue health monitoring system to enhance visibility and control over queue states.
- Enable proactive detection and resolution of queue-related issues to maintain system reliability and performance.
=======
Queue health monitoring is essential for ensuring the reliability and efficiency of MeshHook's processing capabilities. This task aims to implement a robust monitoring system for our Postgres-based durable queues, which are pivotal for managing webhook events and workflow executions. This system will align with MeshHook's goals of providing a highly available, secure, and user-friendly workflow engine by enabling proactive identification and resolution of queue-related issues.

**Objectives:**

- Implement a queue health monitoring system.
- Provide real-time visibility into queue status, including metrics such as queue length, processing time, and error rates.
- Enable alerting for critical conditions, such as queue backlogs or processing delays.

## Technical Specifications

### Architecture Context

<<<<<<< HEAD
MeshHook leverages **pg-boss** or **pgmq** for queue management within Supabase's Postgres service. The queue health monitoring system should integrate seamlessly with these components, utilizing Supabase Realtime for live data feeds without significantly impacting the performance of the queue operations.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Analysis:** Review existing queue management setup and identify critical metrics for monitoring.
2. **Integration Design:** Plan the integration with Supabase Realtime for fetching queue metrics, ensuring minimal performance impact.
3. **Dashboard Development:** Utilize SvelteKit to build a real-time monitoring dashboard, integrating it into MeshHook's existing web interface.
4. **Alerting System:** Leverage Supabase functions or external services (e.g., AWS Lambda) for implementing the alerting logic, including email or SMS notifications based on predefined thresholds.
5. **Testing:** Conduct thorough testing, including performance and load testing, to ensure the monitoring system's reliability and minimal impact on queue operations.
6. **Deployment:** Roll out the monitoring system in stages, starting with a test environment, followed by production deployment after validation.

### Data Model

No significant changes to the existing data model are anticipated. Metrics will be derived from current queue tables and logs, requiring no additional schema modifications.

### API Endpoints

No new API endpoints are necessary. The system will leverage existing Supabase Realtime subscriptions and internal MeshHook APIs for metric collection and alerting functionalities.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Real-time queue health monitoring dashboard is operational, displaying key metrics with less than 10 seconds latency.
- [ ] Alerting mechanism is in place, capable of sending notifications for predefined critical conditions.
- [ ] Monitoring system demonstrates minimal impact on queue performance, with less than 1% increase in processing time.
- [ ] Documentation is comprehensive, clear, and accessible to the MeshHook team.
- [ ] System adheres to MeshHook's security standards, with access control and data protection measures in place.

## Dependencies

- Existing queue management system using **pg-boss** or **pgmq**.
- Access to the Supabase project and services, including Realtime and Postgres.
=======
MeshHook uses **pg-boss** or **pgmq** for its queue management, with Supabase providing Postgres, Realtime, and other services. The queue health monitoring system needs to integrate seamlessly with these existing components without impacting their performance.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Analysis:** Examine the current queue setup and identify key metrics for monitoring.
2. **Design:** 
   - Determine the necessary Supabase Realtime subscriptions for queue metrics.
   - Design the alerting logic and thresholds.
   - Sketch the dashboard UI for visualizing queue health.
3. **Implementation:** 
   - Set up Supabase Realtime subscriptions for queue metrics.
   - Implement the alerting mechanism using Supabase functions or external services like AWS Lambda.
   - Develop the dashboard using SvelteKit, integrating with the existing MeshHook UI.
