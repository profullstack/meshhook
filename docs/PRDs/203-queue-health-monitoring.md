# PRD: Queue Health Monitoring

**Issue:** [#203](https://github.com/profullstack/meshhook/issues/203)  
**Milestone:** Phase 9: Deployment & Operations  
**Labels:** monitoring, hacktoberfest  
**Phase:** Phase 9  
**Section:** Monitoring

## Overview

In the MeshHook project, a webhook-first, deterministic, Postgres-native workflow engine, queue health monitoring is an essential feature for ensuring the reliability and efficiency of workflow execution. This task aims to implement comprehensive monitoring of the queue system to detect, alert, and potentially auto-mitigate common issues that may impact performance or lead to failures in workflow processing. Aligning with MeshHook's goals, this feature will enhance the observability and operational robustness of the system.

**Objective:** Implement a queue health monitoring system that integrates seamlessly with MeshHook's architecture, providing real-time insights into queue performance and health.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

1. Real-time monitoring of the queue length to detect backlogs.
2. Monitoring of queue processing times to identify performance degradation.
3. Automated alerts for critical queue health issues, such as processing delays and backlogged jobs.
4. A dashboard or reporting interface for visualizing queue health metrics.
5. Ability to configure thresholds for alerts based on queue metrics.
6. Support for multi-tenant environments, ensuring that monitoring respects RLS policies.

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** The monitoring system must operate with minimal overhead to avoid impacting the overall system performance.
- **Reliability:** Must provide consistent and accurate monitoring data, with failover capabilities for high availability.
- **Security:** Must comply with MeshHook's security guidelines, especially in handling and displaying sensitive metric data.
- **Maintainability:** Code should be clean, well-documented, and easy to extend or modify.

## Technical Specifications

### Architecture Context

MeshHook uses **pg-boss** or **pgmq** for Postgres-based durable queues. The monitoring system must integrate with these components without requiring significant modifications to their core functionality. It should leverage existing data flow and storage mechanisms in Supabase and SvelteKit where applicable.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Analysis:** Assess current queue architecture to identify key metrics and data points for monitoring.
2. **Design:**
   - Define metrics to be collected, such as queue length, job processing times, and error rates.
   - Design a system for collecting, storing, and querying these metrics efficiently.
   - Create a design for the alerting mechanism, including integration with existing notification systems if available.
   - Plan the user interface for the dashboard/reporting tool.
3. **Implementation:**
   - Implement metrics collection in the queue processing workflow.
   - Develop the backend for storing and querying metrics, using Supabase Postgres where suitable.
   - Build the alerting mechanism based on configured thresholds.
   - Create the frontend for the monitoring dashboard using SvelteKit.
4. **Integration:** Ensure the monitoring system is fully integrated with the existing queue and workflow systems.
5. **Testing:** Perform comprehensive tests to ensure accuracy and reliability of the monitoring data.
6. **Documentation:** Update project documentation to include details of the monitoring system.

### Data Model

No initial data model changes are anticipated. Any required changes identified during implementation should be documented and reviewed.

### API Endpoints (if applicable)

- `GET /api/queue/health`: Fetch current queue health metrics.
- `POST /api/queue/health/alerts/config`: Configure alert thresholds.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Real-time queue health monitoring implemented and operational.
- [ ] Alerting mechanism for critical issues in place and functional.
- [ ] Dashboard for monitoring queue health developed and accessible.
- [ ] Documentation for the monitoring system is comprehensive and clear.
- [ ] Security review completed, ensuring sensitive data is handled according to guidelines.
- [ ] Performance benchmarks confirm minimal impact on overall system performance.

## Dependencies

### Technical Dependencies

- **pg-boss** or **pgmq** for queue management.
- **Supabase** for data storage and real-time capabilities.
- **SvelteKit** for frontend development.

### Prerequisite Tasks

- Ensure all components are updated to the latest versions compatible with the monitoring system requirements.
- Access to monitoring and alerting infrastructure (e.g., email server, Slack webhooks).

## Implementation Notes

### Development Guidelines

- Follow the ESM module system and utilize modern JavaScript features for implementation.
- Adhere to MeshHook's coding standards and best practices for security and performance.
- Implement error handling comprehensively across all new components.

### Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests:** For individual functions and modules handling metrics collection and alerting logic.
- **Integration Tests:** To verify the integration with the queue system and Supabase.
- **E2E Tests:** For the monitoring dashboard and alerting system.

### Security Considerations

- Ensure all API endpoints are protected according to RLS policies.
- Securely handle and store sensitive metric data, following MeshHook's encryption and data handling guidelines.

### Monitoring & Observability

- Leverage the implemented queue health monitoring system for observing its own performance and reliability.
- Set up alerts for the monitoring system's operational issues to ensure continuous health monitoring.
