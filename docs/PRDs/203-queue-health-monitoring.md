# PRD: Queue Health Monitoring

**Issue:** [#203](https://github.com/profullstack/meshhook/issues/203)  
**Milestone:** Phase 9: Deployment & Operations  
**Labels:** monitoring, hacktoberfest  
**Owner:** Anthony Ettinger (Profullstack)  
**License:** MIT  

## Overview

Queue health monitoring is a critical aspect of ensuring the reliability and efficiency of MeshHook's processing capabilities. As MeshHook aims to deliver a webhook-first, deterministic, Postgres-native workflow engine, it's imperative that the system maintains high availability and performance. This task focuses on implementing a robust monitoring system for our Postgres-based durable queues, which manage webhook events and workflow executions. By providing real-time visibility into queue status and enabling proactive issue resolution, this feature will support MeshHook's core objectives.

## Objectives

- Implement a queue health monitoring system to enhance visibility and control over queue states.
- Enable proactive detection and resolution of queue-related issues to maintain system reliability and performance.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

1. **Queue Metrics Collection:** Automatically collect and store key metrics of queue health, including queue length, processing time, and error rates.
2. **Real-Time Monitoring Dashboard:** Develop a user-friendly dashboard to display real-time queue metrics, supporting quick identification of issues.
3. **Alerting Mechanism:** Implement an alerting system that notifies administrators of abnormal queue conditions, such as excessive length or processing delays.
4. **Documentation:** Provide comprehensive documentation on the monitoring system, including setup, configuration, and usage guidelines.

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** The monitoring solution must introduce minimal latency to queue operations, aiming for sub-second impact.
- **Reliability:** Target 99.9% uptime for the monitoring system, ensuring continuous operation.
- **Security:** Adhere to MeshHook's security guidelines, securing monitoring data and ensuring proper access control.
- **Maintainability:** Write clean, modular, and well-documented code, facilitating future updates and enhancements.

## Technical Specifications

### Architecture Context

MeshHook leverages **pg-boss** or **pgmq** for queue management within Supabase's Postgres service. The queue health monitoring system should integrate seamlessly with these components, utilizing Supabase Realtime for live data feeds without significantly impacting the performance of the queue operations.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Analysis:** Review existing queue management setup and identify critical metrics for monitoring.
2. **Integration Design:** Plan the integration with Supabase Realtime for fetching queue metrics, ensuring minimal performance impact.
3. **Dashboard Development:** Utilize SvelteKit to build a real-time monitoring dashboard, integrating it into MeshHook's existing web interface.
4. **Alerting System:** Leverage Supabase functions or external services (e.g., AWS Lambda) for implementing the alerting logic, including email or SMS notifications based on predefined thresholds.
5. **Testing:** Conduct thorough testing, including performance and load testing, to ensure the monitoring system's reliability and minimal impact on queue operations.
6. **Deployment:** Roll out the monitoring system in stages, starting with a test environment, followed by production deployment after validation.

### Data Model

No significant changes to the existing data model are anticipated. Metrics will be derived from current queue tables and logs, requiring no additional schema modifications.

### API Endpoints

No new API endpoints are necessary. The system will leverage existing Supabase Realtime subscriptions and internal MeshHook APIs for metric collection and alerting functionalities.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Real-time queue health monitoring dashboard is operational, displaying key metrics with less than 10 seconds latency.
- [ ] Alerting mechanism is in place, capable of sending notifications for predefined critical conditions.
- [ ] Monitoring system demonstrates minimal impact on queue performance, with less than 1% increase in processing time.
- [ ] Documentation is comprehensive, clear, and accessible to the MeshHook team.
- [ ] System adheres to MeshHook's security standards, with access control and data protection measures in place.

## Dependencies

- Existing queue management system using **pg-boss** or **pgmq**.
- Access to the Supabase project and services, including Realtime and Postgres.

## Implementation Notes

### Development Guidelines

- Follow the existing MeshHook coding standards and practices for SvelteKit and Supabase integration.
- Prioritize security, especially in dashboard access control and data handling.
- Ensure code is modular, well-documented, and easy to maintain.

### Testing Strategy

- Implement unit tests for new components and integration tests for system interactions.
- Perform load testing to evaluate the impact of monitoring on queue performance.

### Security Considerations

- Implement RLS for dashboard access, ensuring that users can only access data relevant to their projects.
- Secure alerting mechanisms to prevent unauthorized access and ensure the integrity of alert notifications.

### Monitoring & Observability

- Utilize Supabase Realtime for live monitoring of queue metrics.
- Implement logging for the monitoring system itself to facilitate debugging and performance tracking.
