title Event Timeline Implementation for MeshHook

package "MeshHook System" {
    [SvelteKit SSR/API] as SvelteKit
    [Supabase Postgres] as Postgres
    [Supabase Realtime] as Realtime
    [Orchestrator Worker] as Orchestrator
    [HTTP Executor Worker] as Executor
}

package "Event Timeline Feature" {
    [Event Timeline UI] as EventUI
    [Event Timeline Logic] as EventLogic
    [Live Logs] as LiveLogs
}

SvelteKit --> EventUI : renders UI
EventUI --> EventLogic : invokes logic
EventLogic --> Postgres : reads/writes events
EventLogic --> Realtime : subscribes to updates
Realtime --> LiveLogs : streams logs
LiveLogs --> EventUI : updates UI in real-time
Orchestrator --> EventLogic : triggers events
Executor --> EventLogic : executes HTTP requests

note right of EventLogic : Follows TDD\nWrites tests before implementation
note right of Postgres : Uses existing schema\nEvent sourcing for state changes
