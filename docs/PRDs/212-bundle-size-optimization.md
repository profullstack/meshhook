# PRD: Bundle Size Optimization

## Overview

This PRD addresses the critical task of optimizing MeshHook's bundle size, a core component of the project's Phase 10: Polish & Launch. Bundle size optimization is pivotal for improving load times, enhancing user experience, and ensuring the efficiency and performance of MeshHook. This task is directly aligned with MeshHook's overarching goals of delivering a lightweight, efficient, and performant workflow engine that combines the simplicity of visual workflow editing with the robustness of a durable execution model.

**Objective:** To significantly reduce the bundle size of both the frontend (SvelteKit/Svelte 5) and backend components of MeshHook without compromising on functionality, security, and performance.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

1. **Bundle Analysis:** Perform a comprehensive analysis of the current bundle to identify large dependencies and potential areas for optimization.
2. **Code Splitting:** Implement code splitting and lazy loading for SvelteKit/Svelte 5 components, ensuring that only the necessary code is loaded and executed.
3. **Dependency Optimization:** Evaluate and, where possible, replace bulky third-party libraries with lighter alternatives that do not detract from functionality.
4. **Asset Optimization:** Apply advanced asset optimization techniques, including image compression, CSS and JavaScript minification, and efficient asset delivery mechanisms.
5. **Testing and Validation:** Ensure that all optimizations preserve the existing functionality, responsiveness, and user experience of the visual DAG builder and other front-end interfaces.

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** Aim for a minimum of 20% reduction in overall bundle size, contributing to faster load times and an improved user experience.
- **Reliability:** Optimization efforts must not introduce new bugs or regressions in existing features.
- **Security:** All changes must conform to MeshHook's stringent security guidelines, ensuring the use of secure and up-to-date libraries and dependencies.
- **Maintainability:** Optimizations should result in clean, well-documented code that adheres to project standards and is easy to maintain.

## Technical Specifications

### Architecture Context

MeshHook utilizes SvelteKit for its frontend and leverages Supabase for backend services, including Postgres for data storage and Realtime for live log streaming. The optimization efforts should encompass both these areas, focusing on minimizing the bundle size while maintaining system integrity and performance.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Bundle Analysis:** Utilize tools like Webpack Bundle Analyzer to pinpoint large dependencies. Audit the usage of current libraries and frameworks for unnecessary imports.
2. **Optimization Techniques:**
   - Implement dynamic imports and code splitting for SvelteKit components.
   - Assess and replace heavy third-party libraries with lighter alternatives.
   - Compress images and static assets, and minify CSS and JavaScript files.
   - Employ tree shaking and dead code elimination to remove unused code.
   - Optimize backend dependencies focusing on Node.js packages.
3. **Validation:** Conduct thorough testing in various environments (development, staging, production) to ensure functional integrity. Monitor performance metrics pre and post-optimization.

### Data Model and API Endpoints

No changes to the data model or new API endpoints are anticipated for this task. The focus remains on optimization without altering the existing data structures or API contracts.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Minimum 20% reduction in the overall bundle size without compromising functionality.
- [ ] Enhanced application load times across desktop and mobile devices.
- [ ] No degradation in functionality, including the visual DAG builder and workflow execution capabilities.
- [ ] Error rates and security posture remain unaffected post-optimization.
- [ ] Documentation is updated to reflect any changes in dependencies or optimization strategies.

## Dependencies

- Access to the current MeshHook codebase and infrastructure.
- Necessary tools for bundle analysis and optimization (e.g., Webpack Bundle Analyzer).
- Approval for any significant changes in libraries or frameworks used.

## Implementation Notes

### Development Guidelines

- Prioritize the use of lightweight, well-supported libraries with strong security records.
- Adopt a mobile-first optimization approach to improve performance across all devices.
- Emphasize asynchronous loading for non-critical components and libraries.

### Testing Strategy

- Conduct extensive testing, including unit, integration, and end-to-end tests, to ensure that optimizations do not negatively impact existing functionality.
- Utilize performance testing tools like Lighthouse to measure and validate improvements in load times and overall performance.

### Security Considerations

- Perform security assessments on new libraries or dependencies to ensure they do not introduce vulnerabilities.
- Ensure that optimizations do not inadvertently expose sensitive data or weaken the application's security posture.

### Monitoring & Observability

- Implement detailed logging and monitoring to track performance improvements and identify potential regressions.
- Compare error rates and response times before and after optimization efforts to gauge their effectiveness.
