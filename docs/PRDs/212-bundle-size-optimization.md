# PRD: Bundle Size Optimization

## Overview and Objectives

In the final phase, Phase 10: Polish & Launch, of the MeshHook project development, a crucial task has emerged â€” Bundle Size Optimization. This task is pivotal as it directly influences the performance and user experience of the MeshHook platform. By reducing the bundle size, we aim to enhance the loading times and overall efficiency of the workflow engine, aligning with MeshHook's objectives to deliver a seamless, fast, and reliable platform for building deterministic, Postgres-native workflows.

**Objective:** Optimize the bundle size of MeshHook's front-end application to ensure faster load times and improved performance without compromising functionality.

## Functional Requirements

1. **Code Splitting:** Implement code splitting to load only the necessary code chunks users need at any given time.
2. **Tree Shaking:** Ensure tree shaking is effectively utilized to eliminate unused code from the final bundle.
3. **Optimize Dependencies:** Analyze and optimize third-party dependencies, replacing or removing bulky libraries where possible.
4. **Asset Optimization:** Compress and optimize images, fonts, and other assets included in the project.
5. **Review and Refactor:** Conduct a comprehensive review of the current codebase to identify opportunities for refactoring and optimization.

## Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** Achieve a significant reduction in the initial load time by optimizing the bundle size, aiming for at least a 20% reduction.
- **Reliability:** Ensure all optimizations do not introduce bugs or affect the existing functionality negatively.
- **Security:** Maintain or enhance current security standards despite changes and optimizations.
- **Maintainability:** Keep the codebase clean, well-documented, and easy to maintain post-optimization.

## Technical Specifications

### Architecture Context

MeshHook utilizes a modern tech stack including SvelteKit for the front-end, leveraging its capabilities for server-side rendering (SSR) and static site generation (SSG). The optimization efforts will primarily focus on the SvelteKit application and how it bundles and serves assets and code.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Preliminary Analysis:** Use tools like Webpack Bundle Analyzer to identify the current state of the bundle size and pinpoint areas for improvement.
2. **Code Splitting:** Utilize SvelteKit's dynamic import() syntax for lazy-loading components and libraries.
3. **Tree Shaking:** Configure Rollup (used by SvelteKit) to ensure tree shaking is effectively removing unused code.
4. **Optimize Dependencies:** Audit current dependencies using tools like `npm audit` and `bundlephobia` to find lightweight alternatives.
5. **Asset Optimization:** Use image compression tools and ensure vector graphics are used where possible.
6. **Refactoring:** Refactor codebase for efficiency, removing duplicate code and unnecessary imports.
7. **Testing and Validation:** Test the application thoroughly to ensure that performance improvements do not compromise functionality or user experience.
8. **Documentation:** Update technical documentation to reflect any changes in the setup or build process due to optimization efforts.

### Data Model

No changes to the data model are required for this task.

### API Endpoints

No new API endpoints will be introduced or modified as part of this optimization task.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Bundle size reduced by at least 20% without loss of functionality.
- [ ] Application load time improved, with first contentful paint occurring within 2 seconds on standard internet connections.
- [ ] All existing tests pass, ensuring no functionality is broken.
- [ ] Codebase remains maintainable, with optimizations well-documented.
- [ ] Security standards are maintained or improved throughout the optimization process.

## Dependencies

- Existing SvelteKit application setup.
- Access to current MeshHook front-end codebase for analysis and modification.
- Tools for bundle analysis and optimization (e.g., Webpack Bundle Analyzer, Rollup).

## Implementation Notes

### Development Guidelines

- Prioritize user experience and application performance.
- Ensure all optimization efforts are thoroughly tested.
- Document changes extensively for future maintainability.
- Follow existing coding standards and practices for consistency.

### Testing Strategy

- **Performance Testing:** Use Lighthouse and PageSpeed Insights to measure performance improvements.
- **Functional Testing:** Conduct regression testing to ensure existing functionality remains unaffected.
- **Code Quality:** Run ESLint and Prettier to maintain code quality standards.

### Security Considerations

- Review all new dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
- Ensure that compression or optimization tools do not introduce security weaknesses.

### Monitoring & Observability

- Monitor application performance pre and post-optimization using Real User Monitoring (RUM) tools.
- Set up alerts for any performance regressions detected post-optimization.
