# PRD: Bundle Size Optimization

## Overview

<<<<<<< HEAD
This PRD addresses the critical task of optimizing MeshHook's bundle size, a core component of the project's Phase 10: Polish & Launch. Bundle size optimization is pivotal for improving load times, enhancing user experience, and ensuring the efficiency and performance of MeshHook. This task is directly aligned with MeshHook's overarching goals of delivering a lightweight, efficient, and performant workflow engine that combines the simplicity of visual workflow editing with the robustness of a durable execution model.

**Objective:** To significantly reduce the bundle size of both the frontend (SvelteKit/Svelte 5) and backend components of MeshHook without compromising on functionality, security, and performance.
=======
The focus of this task is on optimizing the bundle size of the MeshHook project as part of Phase 10: Polish & Launch. Given the project’s emphasis on performance and efficiency, reducing the bundle size is crucial to improve load times, enhance user experience, and align with the core goals of MeshHook, which include providing a lightweight, efficient, and highly performant workflow engine.

**Objective:** Optimize the bundle size of MeshHook’s frontend and backend components without compromising functionality, security, or performance.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

<<<<<<< HEAD
1. **Bundle Analysis:** Perform a comprehensive analysis of the current bundle to identify large dependencies and potential areas for optimization.
2. **Code Splitting:** Implement code splitting and lazy loading for SvelteKit/Svelte 5 components, ensuring that only the necessary code is loaded and executed.
3. **Dependency Optimization:** Evaluate and, where possible, replace bulky third-party libraries with lighter alternatives that do not detract from functionality.
4. **Asset Optimization:** Apply advanced asset optimization techniques, including image compression, CSS and JavaScript minification, and efficient asset delivery mechanisms.
5. **Testing and Validation:** Ensure that all optimizations preserve the existing functionality, responsiveness, and user experience of the visual DAG builder and other front-end interfaces.

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** Aim for a minimum of 20% reduction in overall bundle size, contributing to faster load times and an improved user experience.
- **Reliability:** Optimization efforts must not introduce new bugs or regressions in existing features.
- **Security:** All changes must conform to MeshHook's stringent security guidelines, ensuring the use of secure and up-to-date libraries and dependencies.
- **Maintainability:** Optimizations should result in clean, well-documented code that adheres to project standards and is easy to maintain.
=======
1. Analyze the current bundle to identify the largest dependencies and areas for optimization.
2. Implement code splitting and lazy loading for SvelteKit/Svelte 5 components where applicable.
3. Replace or remove bulky dependencies with lighter alternatives without losing functionality.
4. Ensure the visual DAG builder and other front-end interfaces remain responsive and functional.
5. Optimize asset delivery (images, CSS, JS) via compression and minification.

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** Achieve a noticeable reduction in load time for end-users, targeting a minimum of 20% reduction in the overall bundle size.
- **Reliability:** Maintain existing functionality and ensure no new bugs are introduced through the optimization process.
- **Security:** Ensure all changes adhere to MeshHook’s security guidelines, including the use of secure, up-to-date libraries.
- **Maintainability:** Write clean, well-documented code that follows project conventions and is easy to maintain and update.

## Technical Specifications

### Architecture Context

<<<<<<< HEAD
MeshHook utilizes SvelteKit for its frontend and leverages Supabase for backend services, including Postgres for data storage and Realtime for live log streaming. The optimization efforts should encompass both these areas, focusing on minimizing the bundle size while maintaining system integrity and performance.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Bundle Analysis:** Utilize tools like Webpack Bundle Analyzer to pinpoint large dependencies. Audit the usage of current libraries and frameworks for unnecessary imports.
2. **Optimization Techniques:**
   - Implement dynamic imports and code splitting for SvelteKit components.
   - Assess and replace heavy third-party libraries with lighter alternatives.
   - Compress images and static assets, and minify CSS and JavaScript files.
   - Employ tree shaking and dead code elimination to remove unused code.
   - Optimize backend dependencies focusing on Node.js packages.
3. **Validation:** Conduct thorough testing in various environments (development, staging, production) to ensure functional integrity. Monitor performance metrics pre and post-optimization.

### Data Model and API Endpoints

No changes to the data model or new API endpoints are anticipated for this task. The focus remains on optimization without altering the existing data structures or API contracts.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Minimum 20% reduction in the overall bundle size without compromising functionality.
- [ ] Enhanced application load times across desktop and mobile devices.
- [ ] No degradation in functionality, including the visual DAG builder and workflow execution capabilities.
- [ ] Error rates and security posture remain unaffected post-optimization.
- [ ] Documentation is updated to reflect any changes in dependencies or optimization strategies.

## Dependencies

- Access to the current MeshHook codebase and infrastructure.
- Necessary tools for bundle analysis and optimization (e.g., Webpack Bundle Analyzer).
- Approval for any significant changes in libraries or frameworks used.
=======
MeshHook leverages a combination of SvelteKit for the frontend and various backend services orchestrated via Supabase, including Postgres for data persistence and Realtime for live log streaming. The bundle size optimization should consider both the frontend SvelteKit application and the Node.js backend services.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Analysis:**
   - Use tools like Webpack Bundle Analyzer to identify heavy dependencies and assets.
   - Audit current use of libraries and frameworks to spot unnecessary imports.
2. **Optimization:**
   - Apply code splitting and dynamic imports for SvelteKit routes and components.
   - Evaluate and replace heavy third-party libraries with lighter alternatives or custom implementations if feasible.
   - Optimize images and static assets using compression tools.
   - Implement tree shaking and dead code elimination techniques.
   - Review and optimize backend Node.js dependencies.
3. **Validation:**
   - Test the optimized bundle in various environments (development, staging, production) to ensure functionality remains intact.
   - Monitor performance metrics to validate improvements.

### Data Model

No changes to the data model are anticipated for this task.
