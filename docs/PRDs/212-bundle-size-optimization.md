# PRD: Bundle Size Optimization

## Overview

The focus of this task is on optimizing the bundle size of the MeshHook project as part of Phase 10: Polish & Launch. Given the project’s emphasis on performance and efficiency, reducing the bundle size is crucial to improve load times, enhance user experience, and align with the core goals of MeshHook, which include providing a lightweight, efficient, and highly performant workflow engine.

**Objective:** Optimize the bundle size of MeshHook’s frontend and backend components without compromising functionality, security, or performance.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

1. Analyze the current bundle to identify the largest dependencies and areas for optimization.
2. Implement code splitting and lazy loading for SvelteKit/Svelte 5 components where applicable.
3. Replace or remove bulky dependencies with lighter alternatives without losing functionality.
4. Ensure the visual DAG builder and other front-end interfaces remain responsive and functional.
5. Optimize asset delivery (images, CSS, JS) via compression and minification.

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** Achieve a noticeable reduction in load time for end-users, targeting a minimum of 20% reduction in the overall bundle size.
- **Reliability:** Maintain existing functionality and ensure no new bugs are introduced through the optimization process.
- **Security:** Ensure all changes adhere to MeshHook’s security guidelines, including the use of secure, up-to-date libraries.
- **Maintainability:** Write clean, well-documented code that follows project conventions and is easy to maintain and update.

## Technical Specifications

### Architecture Context

MeshHook leverages a combination of SvelteKit for the frontend and various backend services orchestrated via Supabase, including Postgres for data persistence and Realtime for live log streaming. The bundle size optimization should consider both the frontend SvelteKit application and the Node.js backend services.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Analysis:**
   - Use tools like Webpack Bundle Analyzer to identify heavy dependencies and assets.
   - Audit current use of libraries and frameworks to spot unnecessary imports.
2. **Optimization:**
   - Apply code splitting and dynamic imports for SvelteKit routes and components.
   - Evaluate and replace heavy third-party libraries with lighter alternatives or custom implementations if feasible.
   - Optimize images and static assets using compression tools.
   - Implement tree shaking and dead code elimination techniques.
   - Review and optimize backend Node.js dependencies.
3. **Validation:**
   - Test the optimized bundle in various environments (development, staging, production) to ensure functionality remains intact.
   - Monitor performance metrics to validate improvements.

### Data Model

No changes to the data model are anticipated for this task.

### API Endpoints

No new API endpoints are required for this task.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Bundle size is reduced by at least 20% compared to the baseline without loss of functionality.
- [ ] Application load time is noticeably faster on both desktop and mobile devices.
- [ ] All existing functionality, including the visual DAG builder, operates as expected.
- [ ] No increase in error rates or security vulnerabilities as a result of the optimization.
- [ ] All changes are documented, including rationales for replaced libraries and optimization strategies.

## Dependencies

- Existing MeshHook codebase and infrastructure.
- Access to profiling and bundle analysis tools.
- Approval of selected libraries or frameworks to replace existing dependencies.

## Implementation Notes

### Development Guidelines

- Prioritize lightweight libraries that are well-supported and have a strong security posture.
- Follow a mobile-first approach to optimize performance across all devices.
- Use asynchronous loading for heavy components and libraries that are not critical to the initial render.

### Testing Strategy

- Perform comprehensive testing, including unit, integration, and end-to-end tests, to ensure new optimizations do not break existing functionality.
- Use Lighthouse and other performance testing tools to benchmark and validate improvements.

### Security Considerations

- Conduct a security review of any new dependencies to ensure they do not introduce vulnerabilities.
- Verify that optimizations do not expose sensitive data or compromise the application’s security posture.

### Monitoring & Observability

- Implement logging and monitoring to track performance improvements and identify any potential regressions.
- Monitor error rates and response times before and after deployment to measure impact.
