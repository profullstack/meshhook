# PRD: Secret Access Audit Logging

### Overview

The introduction of secret access audit logging into MeshHook is aimed at enhancing the platform's security posture by providing detailed records of when and by whom secrets are accessed. This feature is critical for regulated industries and any organization prioritizing security, as it helps in forensic analysis and compliance reporting. This task aligns with MeshHook's core goals by bolstering its security features without compromising on its performance and usability.

### Functional Requirements

1. **Audit Log Creation:** Automatically generate audit logs for each secret access, including reads and writes.
2. **Log Details:** Each log entry must include the secret's identifier, access timestamp, user identity (or service account), access type (read/write), and the IP address of the request initiator.
3. **Searchability:** Implement a mechanism to query and filter the audit logs based on the secret identifier, date range, user identity, and access type.
4. **Access Control:** Ensure that viewing audit logs is restricted to users with the appropriate permissions.
5. **Integration:** Integrate the audit logging mechanism seamlessly with the existing secrets management module.

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** The audit logging feature must not introduce significant latency to secret access operations.
- **Security:** Ensure that the audit logs themselves are secure and cannot be tampered with. Implement appropriate access controls.
- **Reliability:** Guarantee high availability of the audit log service, ensuring logs are always written and retrievable upon secret access.
- **Maintainability:** Design the logging system for easy maintenance, including scalable storage solutions and efficient log rotation/archiving mechanisms.

### Technical Specifications

#### Architecture Context and Integration Points

- **Integration with Secrets Vault:** Audit logging functionality will be integrated into the existing secrets vault module.
- **Storage:** Utilize Postgres for storing audit logs, leveraging its reliability and transactional integrity.
- **Supabase Realtime:** Use Supabase Realtime for monitoring audit log entries in real-time, facilitating immediate visibility into secret access events.

#### Implementation Approach

1. **Schema Design:** Extend the database schema to include a new `audit_logs` table with fields for secret ID, access type, timestamp, user identity, and IP address.
2. **Logging Mechanism:** Implement logging logic within the secrets access and modification functions, ensuring every access writes a new log entry to the `audit_logs` table.
3. **Query API:** Develop an API endpoint for querying audit logs, supporting filtering by secret identifier, date range, user identity, and access type.
4. **Permission Checks:** Update the access control module to include permissions for viewing audit logs, ensuring only authorized users can query logs.
5. **Log Management:** Implement log rotation and archiving strategies to manage log size and ensure performance.

#### Data Model Changes

- `audit_logs` table:
  - `id` SERIAL PRIMARY KEY
  - `secret_id` INT REFERENCES `secrets(id)`
  - `access_type` ENUM('read', 'write')
  - `timestamp` TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT now()
  - `user_identity` VARCHAR(255)
  - `ip_address` VARCHAR(45)

#### API Endpoints

- `GET /api/audit-logs`: Fetch audit logs with support for filters (secret_id, date range, user_identity, access_type).

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Audit log entries are created for every secret access and modification.
- [ ] Audit logs include all required details (secret ID, access type, timestamp, user identity, IP address).
- [ ] Audit logs can be queried and filtered based on specified criteria.
- [ ] Only authorized users can access the audit logs.
- [ ] Performance benchmarks meet the non-functional requirements.

### Dependencies and Prerequisites

- Existing secrets management module for integration.
- Postgres database for storing the audit logs.
- Supabase Realtime for log monitoring.

### Implementation Notes

#### Development Guidelines

- Follow the existing code style and patterns for consistency.
- Write unit and integration tests covering new functionality.
- Document the new API endpoint in the project's API documentation.

#### Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests:** Cover the logging mechanism and query API with unit tests.
- **Integration Tests:** Test the integration with the secrets management module and permission checks.
- **Performance Testing:** Ensure the logging mechanism meets performance requirements through benchmarking.

#### Security Considerations

- Ensure audit logs are stored securely and are immutable.
- Implement strict permission checks for accessing the audit logs.

#### Monitoring and Observability

- Monitor the performance impact of the audit logging feature.
- Set up alerts for any failures in the audit log mechanism.

This PRD outlines the approach for implementing secret access audit logging in MeshHook, ensuring the feature enhances the platform's security and compliance capabilities while adhering to the project's performance and reliability standards.
