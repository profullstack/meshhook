# PRD: Concurrent Execution Tests for MeshHook

## 1. Overview

In the realm of workflow engines, MeshHook stands out with its webhook-trigger capabilities, visual simplicity, and durable execution model. As it scales up to accommodate a growing number of users and workflows, ensuring its robustness under concurrent execution becomes paramount. This document outlines the requirements and approach for developing and executing concurrent execution tests. These tests are designed to validate MeshHook's performance, reliability, and scalability when handling multiple workflows simultaneously, aligning with MeshHook's goals of providing a durable, scalable, and secure workflow engine.

### 1.1 Objective

To develop and execute a suite of concurrent execution tests that will:
- Validate MeshHook's ability to perform under various loads of concurrent workflow executions without degradation in performance or reliability.
- Identify any potential bottlenecks or scalability issues in the current architecture.
- Ensure that MeshHook remains a robust solution for users' automation needs.

## 2. Functional Requirements

1. **Test Suite Development:** Design and implement a set of tests to simulate the concurrent execution of multiple workflows, ranging from simple to complex scenarios.
2. **Scalability Testing:** The tests must cover different levels of concurrency, starting from a handful to potentially thousands of concurrent workflows, to uncover any scalability limits.
3. **Performance Benchmarking:** Develop benchmarks for throughput, latency, CPU, memory utilization, and database load during concurrent executions.
4. **Reliability Verification:** Validate that all workflows are executed to completion without errors, data corruption, or loss, under high concurrency.
5. **Documentation:** Create comprehensive documentation detailing the test design, execution processes, findings, and any recommendations for improvements.

## 3. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** Ensure that MeshHook meets or exceeds established performance benchmarks during concurrent workload conditions.
- **Reliability:** The system must maintain its integrity and accuracy of workflow executions, even under extreme load.
- **Scalability:** Demonstrate the ability of MeshHook to scale horizontally, effectively balancing load and utilizing resources efficiently.
- **Maintainability:** The testing codebase should be well-documented, structured for easy maintenance, and extension by other developers.

## 4. Technical Specifications

### 4.1 Architecture Context

MeshHook operates on a microservices architecture, leveraging SvelteKit for the frontend, Supabase for real-time interactions, and serverless functions alongside durable workers for workflow executions. The concurrent execution tests need to integrate with this architecture, paying special attention to database interactions and worker queue management for handling concurrency.

### 4.2 Implementation Approach

1. **Analysis:** Review the current system architecture to identify critical components impacted by concurrency, especially the database layer and worker queues.
2. **Design:** Craft test scenarios that reflect real-world usage, focusing on triggering concurrent workflows, ensuring high-frequency events are sourced accurately, and logs are updated in real-time.
3. **Tool Selection:** Identify tools (e.g., k6 for load testing, Grafana for real-time monitoring) that integrate well with our stack for both testing and monitoring purposes.
4. **Test Development:** Build the test suite with the selected tools, covering all identified critical paths and potential failure points.
5. **Execution and Monitoring:** Perform test runs in a staged environment, closely monitoring system performance and collecting relevant metrics.
6. **Analysis and Optimization:** Analyze the outcomes to pinpoint any system bottlenecks or failure issues, followed by a cycle of refinement and optimization based on findings.
7. **Documentation:** Thoroughly document the testing process, results, and any subsequent system adjustments.

### 4.3 Data Model and API Endpoints

- **Data Model Changes:** No immediate changes are anticipated for the data model specifically for these tests. However, adjustments may be identified during testing to optimize performance under load.
- **API Endpoints:** Existing API endpoints will be utilized for these tests; no additional endpoints are necessary.

## 5. Acceptance Criteria

- A suite of concurrency tests is developed and fully documented.
- Baseline performance metrics are established and met or exceeded.
- MeshHook demonstrates scalability and maintains reliability under high concurrency, with no critical system failures.
- Identified performance improvements are effectively implemented.
- All system modifications are documented and validated through existing unit, integration, and end-to-end tests.
- Test suite findings and system adjustments are reviewed and approved by the development team.

## 6. Dependencies

- Familiarity with MeshHook's current architecture and components.
- Access to appropriate testing and monitoring tools.
- Availability of a controlled test environment that can simulate production-like loads.

## 7. Implementation Notes

### 7.1 Development Guidelines

- Adhere to TypeScript for test scripts to maintain code consistency.
- Follow established coding standards and review processes within the team.
- Design tests to be deterministic, ensuring repeatability and reliability.

### 7.2 Testing Strategy

- **Load Testing:** Simulate realistic load scenarios to measure system performance under various conditions.
- **Stress Testing:** Incrementally increase the load to identify the system's breaking point and observe recovery behaviors.
- **Soak Testing:** Execute the system under high load for prolonged periods to uncover any long-term stability issues.

### 7.3 Security Considerations

- Ensure that test data and environments are secured and do not inadvertently expose sensitive information.
- Adhere to security best practices, especially in scenarios that simulate user interactions or data processing.

### 7.4 Monitoring & Observability

- Leverage Supabase Realtime alongside other monitoring tools like Grafana and Prometheus to track system behavior under test conditions.
- Establish dashboards that display key performance indicators, including but not limited to latency, throughput, error rates, and system resource utilization.

This PRD sets the foundation for ensuring that MeshHook can confidently support its users' needs for reliable, scalable, and efficient workflow automation, even as demand and concurrency levels increase.
