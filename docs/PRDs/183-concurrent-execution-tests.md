# PRD: Concurrent execution tests

## Overview

This document outlines the product requirements for implementing concurrent execution tests for MeshHook, a webhook-first, deterministic, Postgres-native workflow engine. The purpose of these tests is to ensure that MeshHook can handle multiple workflows running simultaneously without degradation in performance or reliability, aligning with the project's goals of delivering a durable, scalable, and secure workflow engine.

### Objective

Develop and execute a suite of concurrent execution tests to validate the performance, reliability, and scalability of MeshHook under various load conditions.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

1. **Test Suite Development:** Develop a comprehensive set of tests that simulate concurrent execution of multiple workflows.
2. **Scalability Testing:** Tests should cover various scales, from a few concurrent workflows to thousands, to identify any bottlenecks or scalability issues.
3. **Performance Benchmarking:** Establish baseline performance metrics for concurrent executions, including but not limited to throughput, latency, and resource utilization.
4. **Reliability Verification:** Ensure that all workflows complete successfully without errors or data loss, even under high load.
5. **Documentation:** Provide detailed documentation of test scenarios, methodologies, and outcomes.

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** Tests must confirm that MeshHook maintains its performance benchmarks under concurrent load.
- **Reliability:** MeshHook should exhibit no decrease in reliability metrics during and after the tests.
- **Scalability:** The system should scale horizontally, demonstrating effective load distribution and resource utilization.
- **Maintainability:** Test code should be clearly documented, easily extendable, and maintainable.

## Technical Specifications

### Architecture Context

MeshHook utilizes a microservices architecture with components including SvelteKit for the frontend, Supabase for real-time database and logs, and a combination of serverless functions and durable workers for workflow execution. The concurrent execution tests must integrate seamlessly with this setup, particularly focusing on the interaction between the database (for queuing and event sourcing) and the workers.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Analysis:** Evaluate the current system architecture and identify components most affected by concurrency, such as the database, worker queues, and execution engine.
2. **Design:** Define test scenarios that mimic real-world usage patterns, focusing on concurrent workflow triggers, high-frequency event sourcing, and real-time log updates.
3. **Tool Selection:** Choose appropriate tools for load testing and monitoring that integrate with our tech stack (e.g., k6 for load testing, Grafana for monitoring).
4. **Test Development:** Develop the test suite using chosen tools, ensuring coverage of all critical paths and failure modes identified in the design phase.
5. **Execution and Monitoring:** Run tests in a controlled environment, monitoring system performance and capturing metrics.
6. **Analysis and Optimization:** Analyze test results to identify bottlenecks or failure points, then iteratively refine and optimize the system.
7. **Documentation:** Document the test process, findings, and any system changes made in response to testing.

### Data Model

No changes to the data model are anticipated specifically for concurrent execution tests. Should adjustments become necessary, updates will be documented and applied via migrations.

### API Endpoints

No new API endpoints are required for this task. The focus is on testing existing endpoints and system components under load.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] A comprehensive suite of concurrent execution tests developed and documented.
- [ ] Baseline performance metrics for concurrent execution established.
- [ ] System demonstrates scalability and reliability under load, with no critical failures.
- [ ] Performance optimizations identified and implemented where necessary.
- [ ] All modifications to the system are documented and pass existing unit, integration, and e2e tests.
- [ ] Test suite and results reviewed and approved by the development team.

## Dependencies

- Current MeshHook architecture and components.
- Access to testing and monitoring tools.
- Adequate test environment for simulating production-like load.

## Implementation Notes

### Development Guidelines

- Utilize TypeScript for test scripts to maintain consistency with the codebase.
- Follow the existing coding standards and review processes.
- Ensure tests are deterministic and repeatable.

### Testing Strategy

- **Load Testing:** Simulate real-world loads to measure how the system performs under various conditions.
- **Stress Testing:** Determine the system's limits by gradually increasing load until the system fails.
- **Soak Testing:** Run the system under a high load for an extended period to identify long-term issues.

### Security Considerations

- Ensure test data and environments do not contain or expose sensitive information.
- Follow best practices for secure test execution, especially when simulating user interactions.

### Monitoring & Observability

- Utilize Supabase Realtime and additional monitoring tools (e.g., Grafana, Prometheus) to observe system behavior under test conditions.
- Set up dashboards to track key performance indicators, including latency, throughput, error rates, and resource utilization.
