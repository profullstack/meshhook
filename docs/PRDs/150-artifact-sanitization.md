# PRD: Artifact Sanitization

## Overview

The task of artifact sanitization is a crucial component in the security layer of the MeshHook project, focusing on the redaction of personally identifiable information (PII) from workflow artifacts. This process aligns with MeshHook's commitment to providing a secure, multi-tenant workflow engine that respects user privacy and complies with global data protection regulations.

**Objective:** Enhance MeshHook's security by implementing a robust artifact sanitization mechanism to automatically redact PII from stored artifacts, ensuring the privacy of sensitive information.

## Functional Requirements

1. **Sanitization Engine Development:** Develop a sanitization engine capable of identifying and redacting PII from workflow artifacts.
2. **Configuration Mechanism:** Enable users to define custom PII redaction rules per project, including the ability to specify what constitutes PII.
3. **Integration with Workflow Pipeline:** Integrate the sanitization engine within the existing workflow pipeline, ensuring that all artifacts are scanned and sanitized before storage.
4. **Audit Logging:** Log all sanitization actions, capturing details about what was redacted, by whom, and when, without storing PII in logs.

## Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** Ensure that the sanitization process adds minimal overhead to the workflow execution time.
- **Reliability:** Achieve a high level of accuracy in PII detection and redaction, minimizing false positives and negatives.
- **Security:** Implement secure coding practices to prevent introducing vulnerabilities within the sanitization engine.
- **Maintainability:** Design the sanitization engine for easy updates as PII detection techniques evolve.

## Technical Specifications

### Architecture Context

The artifact sanitization feature will be integrated into the existing MeshHook architecture, specifically within the workflow execution pipeline, immediately before artifact storage in Supabase.

**Integration Points:**
- **Workflow Execution Pipeline:** Insert the sanitization step post-execution and pre-storage.
- **Supabase Storage:** Ensure sanitized artifacts are stored, replacing or alongside original artifacts.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Requirement Analysis:** Evaluate current artifact handling processes and identify types of PII commonly stored in artifacts.
2. **Design the Sanitization Engine:** Outline the engine's architecture, including PII detection methods (regex patterns, machine learning models, etc.) and redaction techniques.
3. **Integration Planning:** Design the integration with the workflow pipeline, ensuring seamless insertion of the sanitization step.
4. **Development:** Implement the sanitization engine and integration logic, following the TDD approach.
5. **Testing and Validation:** Conduct thorough testing, including unit, integration, and E2E tests, to ensure effectiveness and performance.
6. **Documentation and Deployment:** Update documentation to cover the new sanitization feature and its configuration. Prepare for deployment.

### Data Model Changes

- **Sanitization Rules Table:** Introduce a new table to store user-defined PII redaction rules, including pattern definitions and action specifications.

### API Endpoints

- **GET /projects/{projectId}/sanitization-rules:** Fetches the PII redaction rules for a project.
- **POST /projects/{projectId}/sanitization-rules:** Creates or updates PII redaction rules for a project.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Sanitization engine accurately identifies and redacts PII from artifacts.
- [ ] Users can define and manage custom PII redaction rules.
- [ ] Integration with the workflow pipeline is seamless, with minimal performance impact.
- [ ] All actions are audited and logged appropriately.
- [ ] Documentation is updated to include details about the sanitization feature and how to configure it.
- [ ] The feature passes all security, performance, and reliability benchmarks.

## Dependencies

- Access to the current MeshHook codebase and architecture documentation.
- Supabase for storage and Realtime for log streaming.
- Development tools and libraries for implementing PII detection and redaction algorithms.

## Implementation Notes

### Development Guidelines

- Follow the established MeshHook coding standards, including ESLint and Prettier configurations.
- Ensure code is modular, well-commented, and adheres to security best practices.
- Utilize environment variables for sensitive configurations to facilitate KEK rotation and secure deployment.

### Testing Strategy

- Implement unit tests for individual components of the sanitization engine.
- Design integration tests to evaluate the engine's integration with the workflow pipeline.
- Conduct E2E tests to assess the overall system's performance and reliability in real-world scenarios.

### Security Considerations

- Sanitization rules and logs must be stored securely, with access restricted based on `project_id`.
- Review and apply secure coding practices to prevent injection attacks or unauthorized access to PII.

### Monitoring & Observability

- Implement metrics to monitor the performance impact of the sanitization process.
- Ensure comprehensive logging of the sanitization actions for auditability and debugging.
