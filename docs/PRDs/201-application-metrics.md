# PRD: Application Metrics

## Overview

<<<<<<< HEAD
The goal of this task is to integrate comprehensive application metrics into MeshHook to enhance observability, performance monitoring, and operational efficiency. By embedding metrics collection and reporting within MeshHook, we aim to provide real-time insights into the system's health, usage patterns, and potential bottlenecks. This functionality is crucial for maintaining the high reliability, performance, and security standards set for MeshHook, aligning with its core features like webhook triggers, visual DAG builder, and multi-tenant RLS security.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

1. **Metrics Collection:** Implement a mechanism to collect system and application metrics, including but not limited to throughput, error rates, response times, and system resource usage (CPU, memory, disk I/O, network I/O).
2. **Integration with Monitoring Tools:** Ensure metrics can be easily exported to popular monitoring tools such as Prometheus, Grafana, or an equivalent technology stack.
3. **Live Dashboard:** Implement a live dashboard within the MeshHook admin console for real-time monitoring of key metrics.
4. **Alerting Mechanism:** Develop an alerting mechanism for critical metrics that exceed predefined thresholds.
5. **Documentation:** Provide comprehensive documentation for metrics collection, dashboard usage, and alert configuration.

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** Ensure the metrics collection process minimally impacts system performance.
- **Reliability:** Design the metrics system to be fault-tolerant, ensuring metrics collection continues even in partial system failures.
- **Security:** Adhere to the project's security guidelines, ensuring metrics collection and exposure do not reveal sensitive information.
- **Maintainability:** Implement the metrics system in a way that allows for easy expansion and integration with future monitoring tools and services.
=======
The objective of this Product Requirements Document (PRD) is to articulate the requirements and approach for integrating application metrics into MeshHook. This task is essential for Phase 9: Deployment & Operations, focusing on monitoring. Implementing application metrics is fundamental to achieving operational excellence, providing insights into application performance, and ensuring reliability and scalability. This functionality aligns with MeshHook's goals of delivering a robust, efficient, and secure workflow engine.

## Functional Requirements

1. **Metrics Collection**: Implement a system to collect runtime metrics, including but not limited to, CPU usage, memory usage, request count, error rate, and processing times of webhooks and workflow runs.
2. **Metrics Aggregation**: Aggregate metrics at various granularities (e.g., per minute, hour, day) to support different levels of monitoring and analysis.
3. **Metrics Visualization**: Integrate with a dashboard tool (e.g., Grafana) to visualize metrics in real-time, enabling quick insights into system performance and health.
4. **Alerting Mechanism**: Implement alerting based on threshold values for critical metrics to enable proactive incident management.
5. **Documentation**: Provide comprehensive documentation on metrics collected, the technology stack used for monitoring, and guidance on setting up custom dashboards and alerts.

## Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance**: Metrics collection and aggregation should not significantly impact the application's performance. Collecting metrics should have minimal overhead.
- **Reliability**: The monitoring system should be highly available and resilient to failures.
- **Security**: Ensure that metrics collection and storage are secure, with proper access controls in place to protect sensitive information.
- **Maintainability**: The solution should be easy to maintain and scale, with clear documentation on how to add new metrics or modify existing ones.

## Technical Specifications

### Architecture Context and Integration Points

<<<<<<< HEAD
MeshHook is built on a modular architecture leveraging SvelteKit for the frontend, Supabase for backend services, and a combination of custom workers for orchestration and execution. The application metrics feature should integrate seamlessly with this existing setup, utilizing the following components:

- **Supabase Realtime** for streaming logs and metrics data.
- **External Monitoring Tools** such as Prometheus for metrics storage and Grafana for visualization, which requires the metrics to be exposed in a compatible format (e.g., Prometheus Exposition Format).

### Implementation Approach

1. **Analysis:** Evaluate existing components for metrics that can be captured without additional instrumentation and identify gaps.
2. **Design:**
   - Define the schema for metrics data and identify the Supabase or internal tables for storage.
   - Design the API for metrics collection and exposure, ensuring compatibility with external monitoring tools.
   - Sketch out the dashboard UI for integrating within the MeshHook admin console.
3. **Implementation:**
   - Instrument the existing codebase to emit the identified metrics, utilizing an efficient and minimally invasive method (consider using lightweight libraries or SDKs designed for metrics collection).
   - Develop the metrics API and ensure secure access to this data.
   - Build the live dashboard feature within the MeshHook admin console, using SvelteKit for a consistent development experience.
   - Implement the alerting mechanism, potentially leveraging Supabase functions or external alerting services integrated with the monitoring tools.
4. **Integration and Testing:**
   - Ensure integration with external monitoring tools is seamless and fully documented.
   - Perform comprehensive testing, including load testing to assess the impact of metrics collection on system performance.
5. **Documentation:**
   - Update the MeshHook documentation to include detailed guides on metrics collection, dashboard usage, and alert configuration.
=======
- Utilize Prometheus for metrics collection, given its wide adoption, active community, and compatibility with Kubernetes environments.
- Integrate with Grafana for metrics visualization, leveraging its support for Prometheus data sources and extensive library of dashboards.
- Implement custom metrics exporters in the SvelteKit (SSR/API) and Worker components, exposing standard and custom metrics in a Prometheus-compatible format.
- Use Supabase Realtime for live operation metrics, providing insight into the real-time performance of database operations.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Analysis**: Evaluate the current system architecture to identify critical performance indicators and integration points for metrics collection.
2. **Design**: Define the metrics to be collected, including both system and application-specific metrics. Design a scalable and secure architecture for metrics collection, aggregation, visualization, and alerting.
3. **Implementation**:
   - Integrate Prometheus for metrics collection, configuring it to scrape metrics from the application's components.
   - Develop custom metrics exporters for SvelteKit and Worker components if needed.
   - Set up Grafana for metrics visualization, configuring dashboards for key metrics.
   - Implement alerting rules in Prometheus or Grafana based on predefined thresholds.
4. **Testing**: Validate the metrics collection and alerting system through load testing and observe the accuracy and performance impact.
5. **Documentation**: Document the setup process, including how to configure Prometheus, Grafana, and any custom exporters or dashboards.
