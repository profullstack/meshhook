# PRD: Application Metrics

**Issue:** [#201](https://github.com/profullstack/meshhook/issues/201)  
**Milestone:** Phase 9: Deployment & Operations  
**Labels:** monitoring, hacktoberfest  
**Phase:** Phase 9  
**Section:** Monitoring

## Overview

The goal of this task is to integrate comprehensive application metrics into MeshHook to enhance observability, performance monitoring, and operational efficiency. By embedding metrics collection and reporting within MeshHook, we aim to provide real-time insights into the system's health, usage patterns, and potential bottlenecks. This functionality is crucial for maintaining the high reliability, performance, and security standards set for MeshHook, aligning with its core features like webhook triggers, visual DAG builder, and multi-tenant RLS security.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

1. **Metrics Collection:** Implement a mechanism to collect system and application metrics, including but not limited to throughput, error rates, response times, and system resource usage (CPU, memory, disk I/O, network I/O).
2. **Integration with Monitoring Tools:** Ensure metrics can be easily exported to popular monitoring tools such as Prometheus, Grafana, or an equivalent technology stack.
3. **Live Dashboard:** Implement a live dashboard within the MeshHook admin console for real-time monitoring of key metrics.
4. **Alerting Mechanism:** Develop an alerting mechanism for critical metrics that exceed predefined thresholds.
5. **Documentation:** Provide comprehensive documentation for metrics collection, dashboard usage, and alert configuration.

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** Ensure the metrics collection process minimally impacts system performance.
- **Reliability:** Design the metrics system to be fault-tolerant, ensuring metrics collection continues even in partial system failures.
- **Security:** Adhere to the project's security guidelines, ensuring metrics collection and exposure do not reveal sensitive information.
- **Maintainability:** Implement the metrics system in a way that allows for easy expansion and integration with future monitoring tools and services.

## Technical Specifications

### Architecture Context

MeshHook is built on a modular architecture leveraging SvelteKit for the frontend, Supabase for backend services, and a combination of custom workers for orchestration and execution. The application metrics feature should integrate seamlessly with this existing setup, utilizing the following components:

- **Supabase Realtime** for streaming logs and metrics data.
- **External Monitoring Tools** such as Prometheus for metrics storage and Grafana for visualization, which requires the metrics to be exposed in a compatible format (e.g., Prometheus Exposition Format).

### Implementation Approach

1. **Analysis:** Evaluate existing components for metrics that can be captured without additional instrumentation and identify gaps.
2. **Design:**
   - Define the schema for metrics data and identify the Supabase or internal tables for storage.
   - Design the API for metrics collection and exposure, ensuring compatibility with external monitoring tools.
   - Sketch out the dashboard UI for integrating within the MeshHook admin console.
3. **Implementation:**
   - Instrument the existing codebase to emit the identified metrics, utilizing an efficient and minimally invasive method (consider using lightweight libraries or SDKs designed for metrics collection).
   - Develop the metrics API and ensure secure access to this data.
   - Build the live dashboard feature within the MeshHook admin console, using SvelteKit for a consistent development experience.
   - Implement the alerting mechanism, potentially leveraging Supabase functions or external alerting services integrated with the monitoring tools.
4. **Integration and Testing:**
   - Ensure integration with external monitoring tools is seamless and fully documented.
   - Perform comprehensive testing, including load testing to assess the impact of metrics collection on system performance.
5. **Documentation:**
   - Update the MeshHook documentation to include detailed guides on metrics collection, dashboard usage, and alert configuration.

### Data Model

No changes to the existing data model are required specifically for metrics collection; however, new tables or storage mechanisms may be introduced for dashboard configurations and alert thresholds.

### API Endpoints (if applicable)

- `GET /api/metrics`: Fetches aggregated metrics data for dashboard visualization.
- `POST /api/metrics/alerts`: Configures new alert thresholds.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] System and application metrics are collected efficiently with minimal performance impact.
- [ ] Metrics are easily accessible via popular monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana).
- [ ] A live dashboard for real-time metrics visualization is integrated into the MeshHook admin console.
- [ ] An alerting mechanism for critical metrics is implemented and configurable.
- [ ] Documentation is updated to include comprehensive guides on metrics collection, dashboard usage, and alert configuration.
- [ ] All new code follows the project's coding standards and passes existing linting checks.

## Dependencies

### Technical Dependencies

- External monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana) for metrics storage and visualization.
- Supabase Realtime for streaming metrics data.

### Prerequisite Tasks

- Evaluation of current system capabilities for metrics collection.
- Selection and setup of external monitoring tools, if not already in place.

## Implementation Notes

### Development Guidelines

- Utilize the ESM module system and modern JavaScript features, adhering to Node.js 20+ standards.
- Prioritize efficient and non-intrusive metrics collection methods to maintain system performance.

### Testing Strategy

- Perform unit and integration tests to ensure accurate metrics collection and reporting.
- Conduct load testing to evaluate the performance impact of the metrics collection process.

### Security Considerations

- Ensure metrics collection and exposure processes are secure and do not expose sensitive information.
- Utilize existing RLS and encryption mechanisms for any new data storage introduced for metrics.

### Monitoring & Observability

- Leverage the newly implemented application metrics for internal monitoring and observability improvements.
- Set up key performance indicators (KPIs) and alerts for monitoring system health and performance in real-time.
