# PRD: Application Metrics

## Overview

The objective of this Product Requirements Document (PRD) is to articulate the requirements and approach for integrating application metrics into MeshHook. This task is essential for Phase 9: Deployment & Operations, focusing on monitoring. Implementing application metrics is fundamental to achieving operational excellence, providing insights into application performance, and ensuring reliability and scalability. This functionality aligns with MeshHook's goals of delivering a robust, efficient, and secure workflow engine.

## Functional Requirements

1. **Metrics Collection**: Implement a system to collect runtime metrics, including but not limited to, CPU usage, memory usage, request count, error rate, and processing times of webhooks and workflow runs.
2. **Metrics Aggregation**: Aggregate metrics at various granularities (e.g., per minute, hour, day) to support different levels of monitoring and analysis.
3. **Metrics Visualization**: Integrate with a dashboard tool (e.g., Grafana) to visualize metrics in real-time, enabling quick insights into system performance and health.
4. **Alerting Mechanism**: Implement alerting based on threshold values for critical metrics to enable proactive incident management.
5. **Documentation**: Provide comprehensive documentation on metrics collected, the technology stack used for monitoring, and guidance on setting up custom dashboards and alerts.

## Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance**: Metrics collection and aggregation should not significantly impact the application's performance. Collecting metrics should have minimal overhead.
- **Reliability**: The monitoring system should be highly available and resilient to failures.
- **Security**: Ensure that metrics collection and storage are secure, with proper access controls in place to protect sensitive information.
- **Maintainability**: The solution should be easy to maintain and scale, with clear documentation on how to add new metrics or modify existing ones.

## Technical Specifications

### Architecture Context and Integration Points

- Utilize Prometheus for metrics collection, given its wide adoption, active community, and compatibility with Kubernetes environments.
- Integrate with Grafana for metrics visualization, leveraging its support for Prometheus data sources and extensive library of dashboards.
- Implement custom metrics exporters in the SvelteKit (SSR/API) and Worker components, exposing standard and custom metrics in a Prometheus-compatible format.
- Use Supabase Realtime for live operation metrics, providing insight into the real-time performance of database operations.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Analysis**: Evaluate the current system architecture to identify critical performance indicators and integration points for metrics collection.
2. **Design**: Define the metrics to be collected, including both system and application-specific metrics. Design a scalable and secure architecture for metrics collection, aggregation, visualization, and alerting.
3. **Implementation**:
   - Integrate Prometheus for metrics collection, configuring it to scrape metrics from the application's components.
   - Develop custom metrics exporters for SvelteKit and Worker components if needed.
   - Set up Grafana for metrics visualization, configuring dashboards for key metrics.
   - Implement alerting rules in Prometheus or Grafana based on predefined thresholds.
4. **Testing**: Validate the metrics collection and alerting system through load testing and observe the accuracy and performance impact.
5. **Documentation**: Document the setup process, including how to configure Prometheus, Grafana, and any custom exporters or dashboards.

### Data Model Changes

No new data model changes required specifically for this task.

### API Endpoints

No new API endpoints required specifically for this task.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Prometheus successfully collects and aggregates application metrics.
- [ ] Grafana dashboards accurately visualize key performance indicators in real-time.
- [ ] Alerting mechanisms are in place for critical metrics, with alerts successfully triggered during testing.
- [ ] The monitoring setup has minimal impact on application performance.
- [ ] Documentation provides clear guidance on monitoring setup, metrics collection, and alert configuration.

## Dependencies and Prerequisites

- Access to Prometheus and Grafana installations or cloud services.
- Existing codebase components, particularly understanding of SvelteKit and Worker components for integration.
- Development environment ready for implementing and testing monitoring solutions.

## Implementation Notes

### Development Guidelines

- Follow the existing project architecture, utilizing ESM module system and modern JavaScript features.
- Ensure that metrics collection is modular and easily extensible to support future metrics or changes in monitoring requirements.

### Testing Strategy

- Use unit tests to validate metrics collection logic and any custom exporter functionality.
- Perform integration tests to ensure that metrics are correctly exposed to Prometheus and visualized in Grafana.
- Conduct load testing to assess the performance impact of the monitoring solution and the accuracy of alerting mechanisms under stress.

### Security Considerations

- Ensure that access to metrics endpoints is secured, allowing access only to Prometheus and authorized personnel.
- Apply best practices for securing Prometheus and Grafana, including authentication, encryption, and network policies.

### Monitoring and Observability

- Beyond the scope of application metrics, ensure that logging and tracing are in place for observability into the application's internal operations, particularly for error diagnostics and performance analysis.
