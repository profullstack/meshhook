# PRD: Application Metrics Integration

## Overview

Application metrics integration into MeshHook aims to enhance the platform’s observability, performance monitoring, and operational efficiency by embedding comprehensive metrics collection and reporting capabilities. This integration is pivotal for maintaining MeshHook's high reliability, performance, and security standards, aligning with its core features such as webhook triggers, visual DAG builder, and multi-tenant RLS security. The metrics collected will provide real-time insights into the system's health, usage patterns, and potential bottlenecks, enabling proactive maintenance and optimization.

## Functional Requirements

1. **Metrics Collection:** Implement a robust mechanism for collecting a wide range of system and application metrics, including throughput, error rates, response times, and system resource usage (CPU, memory, disk I/O, network I/O).
2. **Monitoring Tools Integration:** Ensure seamless exportability of metrics to leading monitoring tools like Prometheus and Grafana, facilitating easy integration into existing observability stacks.
3. **Live Dashboard:** Develop a live dashboard within the MeshHook admin console that provides real-time visualization of key metrics, enhancing internal monitoring capabilities.
4. **Alerting Mechanism:** Design and implement an alerting mechanism that notifies administrators when critical metrics exceed predefined thresholds, enabling swift response to potential issues.
5. **Comprehensive Documentation:** Produce detailed documentation covering the setup and usage of metrics collection, dashboard interaction, and alert configuration to ensure ease of use.

## Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** Metrics collection should impose minimal overhead on MeshHook’s overall performance, ensuring system efficiency is maintained.
- **Reliability:** The metrics system must be designed for high availability and fault tolerance, with capabilities to continue metrics collection in the event of partial system failures.
- **Security:** Implement metrics collection and reporting in accordance with MeshHook's strict security guidelines, ensuring that sensitive information remains protected.
- **Maintainability:** Design the system with extensibility in mind, allowing for easy updates and integration with new monitoring tools as they become available.

## Technical Specifications

### Architecture Context

MeshHook operates on a modular architecture leveraging technologies such as SvelteKit for frontend development and Supabase for backend services. The application metrics feature should integrate seamlessly into this existing structure, utilizing:
- **Supabase Realtime** for streaming metrics to the live dashboard.
- **Prometheus Exposition Format** for compatibility with Prometheus and Grafana, facilitating external monitoring.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Analysis:** Conduct a thorough analysis to identify current system components capable of metrics capture and areas requiring additional instrumentation.
2. **Design:** 
   - Outline the metrics data schema and storage strategies, considering Supabase or internal database solutions.
   - Develop an API strategy for metrics collection and exposure, ensuring external tool compatibility.
   - Design the live dashboard interface for integration within the MeshHook admin console, ensuring a consistent user experience with SvelteKit.
3. **Implementation:** 
   - Enhance the codebase to capture defined metrics efficiently, selecting lightweight libraries or SDKs for minimal performance impact.
   - Securely implement the metrics API, ensuring data protection and access control.
   - Develop the live dashboard, leveraging SvelteKit for a seamless front-end experience.
   - Establish an alerting mechanism, possibly utilizing Supabase functions or integrating with external services for comprehensive monitoring.
4. **Integration and Testing:** 
   - Verify the seamless operation of integrations with external monitoring tools, documenting the process thoroughly.
   - Execute a rigorous testing regime, including load testing to evaluate the metrics collection's impact on system performance.
5. **Documentation:** 
   - Update MeshHook documentation to encompass metrics collection, dashboard navigation, and alert setup instructions.

### Data Model

- Introduce new tables or adjust existing schemas to accommodate dashboard configurations and alert thresholds, ensuring alignment with the current data model for seamless integration.

### API Endpoints

- `GET /api/metrics`: Retrieve aggregated metrics for dashboard visualization, supporting query parameters for time ranges and metric types.
- `POST /api/metrics/alerts`: Set up new alert thresholds, including metric identifiers, thresholds, and notification details.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Efficient collection of system and application metrics with minimal performance degradation.
- Seamless integration and accessibility of metrics in popular monitoring tools like Prometheus and Grafana.
- Successful incorporation of a live dashboard within the MeshHook admin console for real-time metrics visualization.
- Functional alerting mechanism for critical metric thresholds with configurable settings.
- Comprehensive documentation covering metrics collection, dashboard interaction, and alert configuration is available and accessible.
- All newly introduced code adheres to MeshHook’s coding standards and passes existing linting checks.

## Dependencies

### Technical Dependencies

- Integration with external monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana) for enhanced metrics storage and visualization capabilities.
- Utilization of Supabase Realtime for live data streaming to the dashboard.

### Prerequisite Tasks

- Preliminary evaluation of current system capabilities for metrics collection.
- Selection, setup, and configuration of external monitoring tools, assuming these are not already in place.

## Implementation Notes

### Development Guidelines

- Embrace modern JavaScript features and the ESM module system, aligning with Node.js 20+ standards.
- Opt for efficient, non-intrusive methodologies in metrics collection to preserve system performance.

### Testing Strategy

- Implement unit and integration testing to ensure accurate and reliable metrics collection and reporting.
- Conduct load testing to measure the impact of metrics collection on overall system performance, making adjustments as necessary.

### Security Considerations

- Secure the metrics collection and exposure process, ensuring sensitive information remains confidential.
- Leverage existing RLS mechanisms and encryption protocols for any newly introduced data storage related to metrics.

### Monitoring & Observability

- Utilize the newly developed metrics for internal monitoring, setting up KPIs and alerts for real-time system health and performance oversight.
