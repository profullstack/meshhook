# PRD: Webhook Endpoint Creation

## Overview

This Product Requirements Document (PRD) details the implementation process for creating webhook endpoints within MeshHook, a webhook-first, Postgres-native workflow engine. The introduction of webhook endpoint creation is a strategic enhancement aimed at enabling MeshHook to act on external triggers, thus broadening its utility and appeal. This feature falls under Phase 5 of the project's development, focusing on the enhancement of the webhook system, and directly contributes to MeshHook's overarching goal of providing a flexible, durable, and user-friendly workflow solution.

### Objective

The primary objective is to develop a system that allows for the dynamic creation, management, and invocation of webhook endpoints. These endpoints will serve as triggers for initiating predefined workflows within the MeshHook engine, thereby facilitating automated, event-driven operations.

## Functional Requirements

1. **Dynamic Endpoint Creation**: Users should be able to create webhook endpoints on-the-fly through both an API and a user interface (UI), specifying which workflow to trigger upon receiving an incoming webhook.
2. **Signature Verification**: Ensure the integrity and authenticity of incoming webhooks by implementing signature verification. This feature should support popular methods such as HMAC, JWT, and other provider-specific signatures.
3. **Payload Validation**: Incoming webhook payloads must be validated against user-defined schemas. Invalid payloads should be rejected with appropriate HTTP status codes, ensuring only valid data triggers workflows.
4. **Event Logging**: All incoming webhook events, including details such as payload, headers, and the status of processing, must be logged. This will assist in debugging and auditing the system.
5. **Rate Limiting**: Implement rate limiting on webhook endpoints to prevent abuse and ensure system stability.
6. **Dynamic Configuration**: Allow users to configure various aspects of webhook endpoints, including secret keys for signature verification, validation rules for payloads, and rate limits.

## Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance**: The system should be capable of processing webhook events swiftly, with the aim of acknowledging incoming requests within 500 milliseconds.
- **Security**: Implement robust security measures to protect webhook payloads and secrets, ensuring encryption in transit and at rest, and follow best practices for endpoint security.
- **Scalability**: Design the webhook system to handle a high volume of incoming events without performance degradation, ensuring horizontal scalability.
- **Usability**: Offer clear and comprehensive documentation to guide users through creating and managing webhook endpoints.
- **Reliability**: Ensure the webhook system is highly available and fault-tolerant, with minimal downtime and data loss.

## Technical Specifications

### Architecture Context

MeshHook uses SvelteKit for its frontend and relies on Supabase for backend services, including the database and real-time functionalities. The webhook feature should integrate with this existing architecture, leveraging Supabase Postgres for storing webhook configurations and logs, and SvelteKit for the UI elements related to webhook management.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Design Phase**:
    - Define JSON schemas for configuring webhooks and validating payloads.
    - Design RESTful API endpoints for the CRUD operations of webhook endpoints.
    - Sketch out the UI for webhook management in the SvelteKit frontend.

2. **Development Phase**:
    - Implement the API endpoints in SvelteKit for managing webhook configurations in the Supabase Postgres database.
    - Create a signature verification module to support various methods (HMAC, JWT, etc.).
    - Develop a rate-limiting mechanism, considering both Supabase functionalities and custom solutions.
    - Ensure event logging integrates with Supabase Realtime for immediate feedback.

3. **Testing and Validation**:
    - Write comprehensive unit and integration tests for all new features.
    - Perform load testing to validate the performance requirements.
    - Validate the end-to-end functionality, from webhook creation to event processing.

### Data Model Changes

- A new `Webhook Configurations` table will be created with the following columns:
  - `id`: Primary Key
  - `project_id`: Foreign Key (links to the Projects table)
  - `url_path`: Text, Unique (the path component of the webhook URL)
  - `workflow_id`: Foreign Key (links to the Workflows table)
  - `secret_key`: Text, Encrypted (used for signature verification)
  - `rate_limit`: JSONB (stores rate limit configuration)
  - `validation_schema`: JSONB (JSON schema for validating incoming payloads)
  - `created_at`: Timestamp
  - `updated_at`: Timestamp

### API Endpoints

- **Create Webhook Endpoint**
  - **Method**: POST
  - **URL**: `/api/webhooks`
  - **Body**:
    ```json
    {
      "url_path": "unique_path",
      "workflow_id": "uuid_of_the_workflow",
      "secret_key": "secret_for_signature_verification",
      "rate_limit": {"type": "simple", "value": "100/minute"},
      "validation_schema": {"type": "object", "properties": {...}, "required": [...]}
    }
    ```
  - **Response**:
    ```json
    {
      "status": "success",
      "data": {
        "id": "uuid_of_the_created_endpoint",
        "url_path": "unique_path",
        "created_at": "timestamp"
      }
    }
    ```

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Dynamic creation of webhook endpoints through API and UI is functional.
- [ ] Signature verification successfully validates incoming webhooks.
- [ ] Payload validation correctly rejects invalid payloads.
- [ ] Rate limiting effectively prevents endpoint abuse.
- [ ] Webhook event logging is integrated with Supabase Realtime.
- [ ] Documentation for managing webhook endpoints is comprehensive and clear.
- [ ] All new code has unit and integration tests with coverage above 90%.

## Dependencies

- Access to the MeshHook Supabase project for database and potential Edge function implementations.
- Integration with existing frontend and backend codebase.

## Implementation Notes

### Development Guidelines

- Adhere to existing project structure and coding conventions.
- Use TypeScript for all new development to ensure type safety.
- Implement robust error handling and logging for all new features.

### Testing Strategy

- Develop unit tests for individual components and functions.
- Create integration tests to verify end-to-end functionality and edge cases.
- Conduct load testing to ensure the system meets specified performance criteria.

### Security Considerations

- Encrypt secrets at rest and enforce HTTPS for all data in transit.
- Apply Supabase Row-Level Security (RLS) policies for multi-tenant data isolation.
- Validate all incoming data rigorously to prevent injection and other web attacks.

### Monitoring and Observability

- Utilize Supabase Realtime for monitoring webhook events as they are processed.
- Implement detailed logging for all stages of webhook processing to aid in debugging and performance monitoring.

Adhering to these specifications will ensure the successful implementation of the webhook endpoint creation feature, significantly enhancing the utility and versatility of the MeshHook engine.
