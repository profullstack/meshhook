# PRD: Webhook Endpoint Creation

## Overview

This document outlines the requirements and technical approach for implementing webhook endpoint creation functionality within the MeshHook project. The task aligns with MeshHookâ€™s Phase 5 milestone focusing on enhancing the webhook system. This feature is pivotal for enabling MeshHook to receive external events via webhooks, thereby initiating workflow runs based on these events. This capability is fundamental to achieving the project's goal of providing a versatile, webhook-first workflow engine.

### Objective

To implement a scalable, secure, and easily manageable system for creating and handling webhook endpoints, enabling external triggers for workflow execution within the MeshHook engine.

## Functional Requirements

1. **Endpoint Creation**: Users must be able to dynamically create webhook endpoints through an API or UI, specifying the associated workflow to trigger.
2. **Signature Verification**: Implement signature verification for incoming webhooks to ensure authenticity, supporting HMAC, JWT, and provider-specific signatures.
3. **Payload Validation**: Validate incoming payloads against predefined schemas, rejecting malformed requests with appropriate HTTP status codes.
4. **Event Logging**: Log webhook event receipts, including payload, headers, and processing status, to facilitate debugging and auditing.
5. **Rate Limiting**: Protect endpoints against abuse/spam with configurable rate limiting.
6. **Dynamic Configuration**: Allow users to configure webhook properties such as secret keys for signature verification, request validation rules, and rate limits.

## Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance**: Webhook processing should be highly performant, with the aim to process and acknowledge incoming requests in under 500ms.
- **Security**: Securely handle webhook payloads and secrets, ensuring data encryption in transit and at rest, and adherence to best practices for endpoint security.
- **Scalability**: Design the webhook system to be horizontally scalable, accommodating high volumes of incoming webhook events without degradation of performance.
- **Usability**: Provide clear, concise documentation for users to create and manage webhook endpoints effectively.
- **Reliability**: Achieve high availability and fault tolerance in the webhook processing system, minimizing downtime and data loss.

## Technical Specifications

### Architecture Context

MeshHook leverages a combination of SvelteKit for the frontend and Supabase for backend services, including database, real-time logs, and storage. The webhook system must integrate seamlessly with this existing infrastructure, utilizing Supabase Postgres for storing webhook configurations and logs, and integrating with the SvelteKit frontend for configuration management.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Design Phase**:
   - Define JSON schemas for webhook configuration and payload validation.
   - Design RESTful API endpoints for creating, updating, and deleting webhook endpoints.
   - Plan the integration with the SvelteKit frontend for managing webhook configurations.
2. **Development Phase**:
   - Implement API endpoints in SvelteKit, handling the creation, update, and deletion of webhook configurations stored in Supabase Postgres.
   - Develop the signature verification module supporting HMAC, JWT, and provider-specific methods.
   - Implement rate limiting using Supabase Edge functions or a custom implementation as required.
   - Integrate event logging into the Supabase Realtime system for visibility.
3. **Testing and Validation**:
   - Write unit and integration tests covering all new functionality and edge cases.
   - Conduct load testing to ensure performance targets are met.
   - Validate the entire flow from webhook creation to event trigger and processing.

### Data Model Changes

- **Webhook Configurations Table**:
  - `id`: Primary Key
  - `project_id`: Foreign Key (links to the Projects table)
  - `url_path`: Unique identifier for the webhook endpoint
  - `workflow_id`: Foreign Key (links to the Workflows table)
  - `secret_key`: Encrypted secret for signature verification
  - `rate_limit`: Rate limit configuration
  - `validation_schema`: JSON schema for payload validation
  - `created_at`: Timestamp
  - `updated_at`: Timestamp

### API Endpoints

#### Create Webhook Endpoint

- **POST** `/api/webhooks`
  - **Body**: 
    ```json
    {
      "url_path": "string",
      "workflow_id": "uuid",
      "secret_key": "string",
      "rate_limit": "string",
      "validation_schema": "object"
    }
    ```
  - **Response**:
    ```json
    {
      "status": "success",
      "data": {
        "id": "uuid",
        "url_path": "string",
        "created_at": "timestamp"
      }
    }
    ```

Additional endpoints for updating and deleting webhook configurations will follow a similar structure.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] API endpoints for creating, updating, and deleting webhook configurations are implemented and functional.
- [ ] Webhook signature verification works as intended for supported methods.
- [ ] Payload validation against user-defined schemas is operational.
- [ ] Rate limiting effectively prevents abuse of webhook endpoints.
- [ ] Event logging provides clear visibility into webhook processing.
- [ ] Documentation is updated with clear instructions on managing webhook endpoints.
- [ ] All new code is covered by unit and integration tests with a coverage rate above 90%.

## Dependencies

- Access to the MeshHook Supabase project for database and potentially Edge function deployment.
- Existing codebase for integration, particularly the frontend for UI updates and backend services.

## Implementation Notes

### Development Guidelines

- Follow the existing project structure and coding conventions.
- Utilize TypeScript for type safety and better code documentation.
- Ensure comprehensive error handling and logging for troubleshooting and monitoring.

### Testing Strategy

- Implement unit tests for individual functions and components.
- Conduct integration tests to validate the end-to-end functionality of the webhook system.
- Perform load testing to ensure the system meets performance benchmarks.

### Security Considerations

- Utilize Supabase RLS policies for multi-tenant security.
- Ensure encryption of secrets both in transit and at rest.
- Implement rigorous input validation to mitigate injection attacks.

### Monitoring and Observability

- Integrate with Supabase Realtime for live monitoring of webhook events.
- Utilize logging for all webhook processing stages, ensuring visibility into performance and errors.

By adhering to these guidelines and requirements, the implementation of the webhook endpoint creation feature will significantly enhance MeshHook's capabilities, making it a more versatile and secure workflow engine.
