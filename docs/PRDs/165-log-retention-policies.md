# PRD: Log Retention Policies

## Overview

The introduction of log retention policies in MeshHook is pivotal for efficient log management, optimizing storage utilization, and adhering to compliance requirements. By automating the deletion and archival of logs, MeshHook aims to enhance its observability features while maintaining a balance between accessibility of historical data and resource optimization. This initiative directly supports MeshHook's commitment to providing a scalable, secure, and maintainable workflow engine by addressing the growing need for sophisticated log management capabilities.

## Objectives

- To implement customizable log retention policies that support automated log management.
- To ensure MeshHook's logging system remains efficient, compliant, and user-friendly.

## Functional Requirements

1. **Customizable Log Retention Policies:** Users must be able to define log retention policies at the project level, specifying the duration for which logs should be retained and the criteria for their rotation or deletion.
   
2. **Automated Log Management:** The system must automatically delete or archive logs that exceed the retention period defined in the policy.

3. **Notification System:** Users should receive notifications regarding automated log deletion or archival actions, detailing the nature and scope of the action taken.

4. **Manual Log Management:** Users must have the ability to manually delete or archive logs, providing flexibility in log management.

5. **Policy Enforcement:** The system must enforce retention policies consistently across all log types and levels, ensuring comprehensive coverage.

6. **UI Integration:** The logging interface should be updated to allow users to easily configure retention policies and view logs subject to these policies.

## Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** The log management process, including deletion and archival, must not degrade the performance of MeshHook's core functionalities.
  
- **Reliability:** The system should manage logs accurately and consistently, ensuring no unintended log data is lost during the retention process.

- **Security:** Secure processes must be implemented for the deletion and archival of logs, with adherence to best practices in data protection and privacy.

- **Maintainability:** The log retention feature should be designed for easy maintenance and future scalability.

## Technical Specifications

### Architecture Integration

MeshHook utilizes SvelteKit for its front end and Supabase for backend services, including real-time logging. The addition of log retention policies requires integration with these existing components, focusing particularly on the logging subsystem. This feature will leverage background workers for scheduled tasks, ensuring minimal impact on the main application's performance.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Schema Update:** Modify the `project` table to include fields for log retention configuration (`log_retention_period`, `log_retention_last_enforced`).

2. **Background Workers:** Develop a scheduled task within the worker system to enforce log retention policies, identifying logs eligible for deletion or archival based on the policy settings.

3. **UI Updates:** Implement UI changes within the SvelteKit application to enable users to configure log retention policies and manage logs manually.

4. **Notification System:** Integrate user notifications for automated log actions using Supabase's real-time capabilities or alternative messaging services.

### Data Model Adjustments

- **`project` Table Enhancements:**
  - `log_retention_period`: Integer, representing the number of days to retain logs.
  - `log_retention_last_enforced`: Timestamp, indicating the last time the retention policy was enforced.

### API Endpoints

- **Update Project Settings:** `PATCH /projects/{id}` should be extended to include log retention settings.
- **Fetch Log Retention Settings:** `GET /projects/{id}/log-retention` will retrieve the project's current log retention policy.
- **Manual Log Management:** `POST /logs/{id}/actions` for manual deletion or archival of logs.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Log retention policies are configurable at the project level.
- Logs are automatically managed (deleted/archived) based on the retention policy.
- Users receive notifications regarding automated log actions.
- Manual log management functionality is fully operational.
- The UI accurately reflects log retention policies and their effects.
- Log management processes do not significantly impact system performance.
- Documentation is updated to include log retention feature details.

## Dependencies

- **Supabase** for backend services.
- **Existing infrastructure** for logging and project settings.
- **Background worker system** for implementing scheduled tasks.

## Implementation Notes

### Development Guidelines

- Adhere to MeshHook's coding standards, focusing on clean, modular code for easy maintenance and scalability.
- Ensure secure coding practices, especially for data handling and user notifications.

### Testing Strategy

- **Unit Testing:** For new functions and components handling log retention logic.
- **Integration Testing:** To ensure the log retention policies work as expected within the broader system architecture.
- **Manual Testing:** For UI changes and manual log management functionalities.

### Security Considerations

- Securely manage log data, especially during deletion and archival processes.
- Implement robust permission checks for users managing log retention policies.

### Monitoring and Observability

- Monitor the performance and execution of the background worker tasked with log retention policy enforcement.
- Log actions taken by the automated log management system for auditability and troubleshooting.

This PRD outlines the approach to integrating log retention policies into MeshHook, addressing key requirements for efficient log management while aligning with the project's overarching goals of scalability, security, and maintainability.
