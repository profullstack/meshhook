# PRD: Structured Logging Implementation for MeshHook

## Overview

The implementation of structured logging is a strategic enhancement to MeshHook, aimed at bolstering the system's observability and diagnostic capabilities. By transitioning to structured logging, MeshHook will be equipped to efficiently capture, query, and analyze log data, thereby accelerating issue resolution times, and providing deeper insights into workflow executions and system health. This initiative is directly aligned with MeshHook's objectives of delivering a robust, scalable, and observable webhook-first workflow engine.

## Functional Requirements

1. **Framework Selection and Integration:** Implement a structured logging framework that is compatible with Node.js and integrates seamlessly with SvelteKit and Supabase environments. The chosen framework should support JSON formatted logs.

2. **Detailed Log Content:** Logs must include essential information such as timestamps, log levels (e.g., INFO, ERROR, DEBUG), messages, workflow IDs, tenant IDs, and error specifics where necessary.

3. **Automatic Context Inclusion:** Automatically append contextual information to each log entry, including execution contexts like request IDs or workflow states, to streamline tracing and troubleshooting processes.

4. **Configurable Logging:** Enable dynamic configuration of logging parameters, including log level thresholds and output formats (console, file, external services), without requiring system restarts.

5. **Seamless Component Integration:** Integrate structured logging with all key components and services within MeshHook, including but not limited to webhook intake, workflow orchestrator, and HTTP executors.

## Non-Functional Requirements

- **Minimal Performance Impact:** The logging mechanism should exert negligible influence on the system's performance. Performance benchmarks should be conducted to validate this criterion.
- **Consistency and Reliability:** Ensure logs are consistently formatted and reliably generated, even under conditions of high load or partial system failures.
- **Security:** Implement mechanisms to automatically redact or exclude sensitive information (e.g., PII, secrets) from the logs.
- **Maintainability:** The logging framework and its implementation should be straightforward to maintain, extend, and integrate with future system components or services.

## Technical Specifications

### Architecture Context

Given MeshHook's architecture, which includes a SvelteKit/Svelte 5 frontend and a Supabase (Postgres) backend, the structured logging solution must be compatible and easily integrated across these technologies. It should leverage Supabase Realtime for potential live log streaming scenarios and align with the event-sourced, deterministic engine design principles of MeshHook.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Framework Evaluation:** Assess and select a structured logging library (e.g., Pino or Winston) that aligns with MeshHook's Node.js and SvelteKit framework.
2. **Design Integration Points:** Outline the integration of structured logging with MeshHook's components, ensuring the logging mechanism is non-intrusive and maintains the integrity of existing functionalities.
3. **System-Wide Implementation:** Gradually integrate structured logging across MeshHook, prioritizing critical pathways such as webhook intake and workflow execution processes.
4. **Performance and Reliability Testing:** Conduct thorough testing to evaluate the performance impact and reliability of the logging system, making optimizations as necessary.
5. **Documentation Update:** Revise the project's technical documentation to incorporate structured logging configurations, best practices, and utilization guidelines for debugging.

### Data Model and API Endpoints

- **Data Model:** No direct changes to the data model are necessitated by this implementation. However, documentation should be updated to reflect any new logging-related configuration settings.
- **API Endpoints:** This implementation does not require new API endpoints. Adjustments to existing endpoints may include enhanced logging for improved observability and diagnostics.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Structured logging is fully implemented and operational across MeshHook's major components and services.
- Logs comprehensively include essential contextual information, facilitating efficient debugging and system monitoring.
- Performance benchmarks confirm the logging mechanism's minimal impact on overall system performance.
- Sensitive information is systematically redacted from logs, ensuring compliance with security standards.
- Documentation accurately reflects the structured logging system, including configuration and usage guidelines.

## Dependencies and Prerequisites

- The selection of a structured logging library that is compatible with MeshHook's current technological stack.
- Access to appropriate development and staging environments for thorough testing and evaluation of the logging system.

## Implementation Notes

### Development Guidelines

- Adhere to MeshHook's existing coding conventions and patterns.
- Implement logging in a non-blocking manner to prevent adverse effects on system performance.
- Ensure logging configurations can be dynamically adjusted to facilitate real-time logging level changes.

### Testing Strategy

- **Unit Testing:** Verify that logging captures and formats information correctly across different log levels.
- **Integration Testing:** Confirm that logging functions seamlessly across various components and services, without compromising performance or reliability.
- **Performance Testing:** Benchmark the impact of logging on system performance and optimize as necessary.

### Security Considerations

- Design the logging system to automatically exclude or redact sensitive data.
- Incorporate logging output reviews as part of the code review process to ensure adherence to security protocols.

### Monitoring and Observability

- Explore possibilities for integrating structured logs with Supabase Realtime and external observability platforms to facilitate real-time monitoring and alerting capabilities.
- Ensure that logs are structured in a queryable format, enhancing the system's observability and supporting integration with tools such as Elasticsearch or Grafana for advanced log analysis.
