# PRD: Event Timeline

**Issue:** [#133](https://github.com/profullstack/meshhook/issues/133)  
**Milestone:** Phase 3: Frontend (SvelteKit)  
**Labels:** run-console  
**Phase:** Phase 3  
**Section:** Run Console

---

## Overview

The Event Timeline is a critical feature in the Run Console section of MeshHook, aimed at enhancing user experience by providing a visual representation of event sequences in workflow runs. This feature aligns with MeshHook's goal to deliver a deterministic, Postgres-native workflow engine with a focus on simplicity, durability, and security. By implementing an Event Timeline, users will gain deeper insights into their workflow executions, enabling quicker diagnostics and understanding of each step within their workflows.

## Functional Requirements

1. **Event Visualization:** Display a chronological timeline of events for each workflow run, including triggers, actions, and outcomes.
2. **Filter and Search:** Users should be able to filter the timeline by event type and search for specific events.
3. **Event Details:** Clicking on an event in the timeline should display detailed information about that event, such as timestamp, payload, and status.
4. **Integration with Run Console:** The Event Timeline must seamlessly integrate with the existing Run Console UI and workflows.
5. **Real-time Updates:** The timeline should update in real-time as events occur during workflow execution.

## Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** The Event Timeline must load quickly and update in real time without significant delays.
- **Reliability:** The feature should accurately display all events in the order they occurred, ensuring data integrity and consistency.
- **Security:** Adhere to MeshHook's security guidelines, ensuring that sensitive information in event payloads is appropriately masked or redacted.
- **Maintainability:** Code for the Event Timeline should be modular, well-documented, and easy to update or extend.

## Technical Specifications

### Architecture Context

- **Frontend:** SvelteKit (with Svelte 5) for implementing the interactive timeline UI.
- **Backend:** Supabase Realtime for streaming event data to the frontend.
- **Data Storage:** Postgres, leveraging existing database schemas for event logging.

### Implementation Approach

1. **UI Design:** Design the Event Timeline component in Figma, ensuring it integrates well with the Run Console's current layout.
2. **SvelteKit Component:** Develop the timeline as a SvelteKit component, utilizing Supabase Realtime subscriptions to receive event data.
3. **Event Streaming:** Modify existing backend workflows to publish event data to Supabase Realtime, ensuring each event is tagged with a unique workflow run identifier.
4. **Integration Testing:** Ensure the new component works seamlessly within the Run Console, displaying real-time data without impacting performance.
5. **User Feedback:** Conduct user testing with a small group to gather feedback and make necessary adjustments.

### Data Model

No changes to the existing data model are required. The implementation will utilize existing event logging mechanisms.

### API Endpoints

No new API endpoints will be created. The implementation will use existing Supabase Realtime subscriptions.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Event Timeline is integrated into the Run Console, displaying a chronological sequence of events.
- [ ] Users can filter and search the timeline for specific events.
- [ ] Detailed event information is accessible and displays correctly.
- [ ] The timeline updates in real-time with minimal latency.
- [ ] Performance benchmarks are met, with the timeline loading and updating quickly.
- [ ] Security and privacy standards are upheld, with sensitive information properly masked.

## Dependencies

- **Technical:** Supabase account access, existing Postgres database schema, and SvelteKit setup.
- **Prerequisite:** Completion of prior Run Console features and user authentication mechanisms.

## Implementation Notes

### Development Guidelines

- Utilize TypeScript for type safety and easier maintenance.
- Follow SvelteKit best practices for component development and state management.
- Subscribe to Supabase Realtime in a way that minimizes unnecessary re-renders and optimizes component performance.

### Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests:** For individual functions and utility methods.
- **Component Tests:** Using Jest and Testing Library to verify the timeline component behaves as expected.
- **Integration Tests:** To ensure the component interacts correctly with Supabase Realtime and displays data correctly.

### Security Considerations

- Ensure all event data displayed in the timeline is sanitized and free of sensitive information.
- Utilize Supabase RLS policies to restrict access to event data based on user permissions.

### Monitoring & Observability

- Implement logging for any errors that occur when fetching or rendering event data.
- Monitor the performance impact of the real-time subscription, optimizing as necessary.
