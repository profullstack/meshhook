# PRD: Getting Started Guide

**Issue:** [#185](https://github.com/profullstack/meshhook/issues/185)  
**Milestone:** Phase 8: Documentation  
**Labels:** user-documentation, hacktoberfest  
**Phase:** Phase 8  
**Section:** User Documentation

---

## Overview

This Getting Started Guide is an essential component of the MeshHook project's User Documentation. Its main objective is to equip new users with the knowledge and tools needed to begin using MeshHook effectively. The guide will align with MeshHook's core goals, providing clear, step-by-step instructions and examples for setting up webhooks, creating workflows with the visual DAG builder, and understanding MeshHook's event sourcing and security features.

## Functional Requirements

1. **Guide Structure:** Develop a structured outline for the guide that includes an introduction to MeshHook, setup instructions, a tutorial for creating a simple workflow, and references to advanced features.
2. **Content Creation:** Write clear, concise content for each section of the guide, incorporating screenshots and code snippets where applicable.
3. **Example Workflows:** Include example workflows that demonstrate key features of MeshHook, such as webhook triggers, the visual DAG builder, and live logs.
4. **Best Practices:** Provide best practices for workflow design and management within MeshHook, including error handling and security considerations.
5. **Resources Section:** Compile a list of additional resources, such as links to the API documentation, advanced tutorials, and community forums.

## Non-Functional Requirements

- **Usability:** Ensure the guide is user-friendly, with easy-to-follow instructions suitable for beginners.
- **Accessibility:** The guide should be accessible, following web content accessibility guidelines.
- **Maintainability:** Structure the guide in a modular fashion to facilitate easy updates as MeshHook evolves.
- **Localization Readiness:** Prepare the document structure for potential future localization efforts.

## Technical Specifications

### Architecture Context

The guide will be hosted as part of the MeshHook documentation site, built with SvelteKit to ensure consistency with the existing project infrastructure. The guide will not require changes to the core MeshHook architecture but will integrate seamlessly with the current user interface and documentation framework.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Outline Development:** Collaborate with the project team to develop a comprehensive outline for the Getting Started guide.
2. **Content Creation:** Write the content for each section, starting with high-priority areas such as installation/setup and basic workflow creation.
3. **Media Inclusion:** Work with the UI/UX team to create and embed screenshots and diagrams that enhance the guide's clarity.
4. **Internal Review:** Conduct reviews with the development and documentation teams to ensure accuracy and completeness.
5. **Publication:** Publish the guide on the MeshHook documentation site, ensuring it is correctly linked within the site's navigation.
