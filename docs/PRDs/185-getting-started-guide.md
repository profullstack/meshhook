# PRD: Getting Started Guide for MeshHook

## Overview

This Product Requirements Document (PRD) outlines the creation of a Getting Started Guide for MeshHook, a webhook-first, deterministic, Postgres-native workflow engine. This guide aims to empower new users with the necessary knowledge and tools to quickly start using MeshHook, covering its key features such as webhook triggers, the visual DAG builder, and its event sourcing capabilities. By providing clear, step-by-step instructions, example workflows, and best practices, the guide will facilitate a smooth onboarding experience, aligning with MeshHook’s goal of delivering a user-friendly, robust automation solution.

## 1. Functional Requirements

1. **Structured Outline**: Develop a comprehensive outline for the Getting Started Guide that includes:
   - Introduction to MeshHook and its core features
   - Step-by-step installation and setup instructions
   - Tutorial for creating a simple workflow
   - Overview of advanced features and best practices

2. **Content Creation**: Write detailed, understandable content for each section, ensuring technical accuracy and beginner-friendliness. This includes:
   - Descriptive explanations of MeshHook’s components and architecture
   - Clear, actionable setup instructions
   - Step-by-step guides for example workflows with screenshots and code snippets

3. **Example Workflows**: Document at least three example workflows that showcase MeshHook’s capabilities, focusing on:
   - Webhook triggers with signature verification
   - Creating and managing workflows with the visual DAG builder
   - Monitoring and debugging workflows using live logs

4. **Best Practices Section**: Provide users with best practices for designing and managing workflows in MeshHook, covering:
   - Error handling strategies
   - Security best practices, including secrets management and RLS

5. **Resources Compilation**: Include a resources section with links to further documentation, such as:
   - MeshHook API documentation
   - Advanced tutorials and use cases
   - Community forums and support channels

## 2. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Usability**: The guide must be easily understandable by new users, with a logical flow and clear, concise language.
- **Accessibility**: Follow web content accessibility guidelines to ensure the guide is accessible to all users.
- **Maintainability**: Write the guide in a modular way to facilitate easy updates in line with MeshHook’s evolution.
- **Localization Readiness**: Prepare the guide for easy translation, considering future localization efforts.

## 3. Technical Specifications

### Architecture Context

The Getting Started Guide will be integrated into the existing MeshHook documentation site, which is built with SvelteKit. This ensures a seamless user experience and consistency with the broader MeshHook ecosystem. Highlighting the integration points, the guide will link to relevant parts of the MeshHook UI and API, promoting a hands-on learning experience.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Outline Development**: Collaborate with the MeshHook team to finalize the guide’s outline.
2. **Content Creation**: Sequentially develop content for each section, prioritizing ease of understanding and engagement.
3. **Media Inclusion**: Work with the design team to create and incorporate relevant screenshots, diagrams, and GIFs.
4. **Internal Review**: Review the guide with the MeshHook development and documentation teams for technical accuracy and completeness.
5. **Publication**: Integrate and publish the guide on the MeshHook documentation site, ensuring navigational accessibility.

## 4. Acceptance Criteria

- The guide provides a comprehensive introduction to MeshHook for new users.
- Installation and setup instructions are easy to follow, with no prerequisites assumed.
- Example workflows clearly demonstrate MeshHook’s core functionalities.
- Best practices for workflow design and security are articulated and easy to understand.
