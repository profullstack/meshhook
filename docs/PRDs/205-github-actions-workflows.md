# PRD: GitHub Actions Workflows for MeshHook

## Overview

<<<<<<< HEAD
The integration of GitHub Actions workflows into the MeshHook project represents a strategic enhancement aimed at automating the continuous integration (CI) and continuous deployment (CD) processes. This initiative is designed to streamline the development lifecycle, enhancing productivity, and ensuring high standards of code quality and security. By harnessing GitHub Actions, MeshHook aspires to automate testing, linting, and deployment processes, thereby facilitating a more efficient and error-free development workflow. This integration is pivotal for maintaining the robustness, scalability, and ease of maintenance that MeshHook aims to deliver, resonating with its core features like webhook triggers, visual DAG builder, durable runs, live logs, and multi-tenant RLS security.

## Functional Requirements

1. **CI Workflow:**
   - Trigger automatically on every push to `main` and on pull request creation against `main`.
   - Execute all unit and integration tests.
   - Perform code linting and validate coding standards.
   - Complete a build process to verify the absence of build errors.
2. **CD Workflow:**
   - Activate on every merge into `main`.
   - Facilitate the deployment of the application to a staging environment.
   - Conduct smoke tests within the staging environment to ensure deployment integrity.
   - Enable manual triggering for production deployment upon successful staging validation.
3. **Security Scan Workflow:**
   - Schedule to run weekly, with the option for on-demand execution.
   - Implement static code analysis to detect security vulnerabilities.
   - Configure to alert the development team upon the identification of vulnerabilities.

## Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** CI workflows should execute within 5 minutes to optimize developer productivity.
- **Reliability:** Workflows must include robust error handling mechanisms to manage transient errors effectively.
- **Security:** Securely manage sensitive information, such as deployment credentials, using GitHub's encrypted secrets.
- **Maintainability:** Code should be modular and well-documented to facilitate easy updates and maintenance.
=======
This task is aimed at establishing and optimizing GitHub Actions workflows to automate the continuous integration (CI) and continuous deployment (CD) processes for MeshHook. By integrating GitHub Actions, we aim to streamline the development cycle, ensuring that code changes are automatically tested and deployed, thus aligning with MeshHook's goal of delivering a robust, scalable, and easy-to-maintain webhook-first workflow engine.

The GitHub Actions workflows will be designed to support MeshHook's core features, including webhook triggers, visual DAG builder, durable runs, live logs, and multi-tenant RLS security, by ensuring that all integrations and functionalities are continuously validated against our suite of automated tests and deployment pipelines.

## Functional Requirements

1. **CI Workflow:**
   - Automatically trigger on every push to `main` and pull request creation against `main`.
   - Run all unit and integration tests.
   - Validate coding standards and linting.
   - Build the project to ensure no build errors.
2. **CD Workflow:**
   - Trigger on every merge into `main`.
   - Deploy the application to the staging environment.
   - Run smoke tests against the staging environment.
   - Manual trigger for production deployment after staging validation.
3. **Security Scanning Workflow:**
   - Schedule to run weekly and on demand.
   - Include static code analysis to identify security vulnerabilities.
   - Alert the team on discovery of vulnerabilities.

## Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** Workflows must execute within acceptable time frames to not hinder development speed (preferably under 5 minutes for CI workflows).
- **Reliability:** Workflows must be configured with proper error handling to gracefully recover from transient errors where possible.
- **Security:** Use GitHub's encrypted secrets for storing sensitive information required for workflows (e.g., deployment credentials).

## Technical Specifications

### Architecture Context

<<<<<<< HEAD
MeshHook employs a microservices architecture with a frontend powered by SvelteKit/Svelte 5, backend functionalities provided by Supabase, and various workers handling task processing. The GitHub Actions workflows need to be seamlessly integrated with this architecture to automate testing, building, and deployment processes efficiently.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Initialize GitHub Actions:**
   - Create the `.github/workflows` directory within the repository.
   - Add YAML files to define the CI, CD, and Security workflows.
2. **Configure CI Workflow:**
   - Setup jobs for linting, testing, and building the application.
   - If necessary, use a matrix strategy to test across multiple environments.
3. **Configure CD Workflow:**
   - Utilize GitHub environments to manage deployments to staging and production.
   - Secure deployments with environment-specific secrets.
   - Implement manual approval steps for production deployments.
4. **Configure Security Scanning:**
   - Integrate a tool for static code analysis, such as CodeQL or SonarCloud.
   - Setup notifications for any discovered vulnerabilities.

### Data Model

This task requires no changes to the existing data model.
=======
MeshHook utilizes a microservices architecture pattern with components orchestrated through SvelteKit/Svelte 5 for frontend, Supabase for backend services, and various workers for processing tasks. GitHub Actions workflows should integrate seamlessly with this existing setup, providing automated testing, building, and deployment processes.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Setup GitHub Actions in the Repository:**
   - Create a new `.github/workflows` directory.
   - Add separate YAML configuration files for CI, CD, and Security workflows.
2. **CI Workflow Configuration:**
   - Define jobs for linting, testing, and building.
   - Utilize matrix strategy for testing across different environments if necessary.
3. **CD Workflow Configuration:**
   - Leverage GitHub environments for managing staging and production deployments.
   - Implement environment-specific secrets for secure deployments.
   - Setup manual review/approval steps for production deployment.
4. **Security Workflow Configuration:**
   - Integrate a static code analysis tool (e.g., CodeQL, SonarCloud).
   - Configure alerting for found vulnerabilities.

### Data Model

No data model changes are required for this task.
