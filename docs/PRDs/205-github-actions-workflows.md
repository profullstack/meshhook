# PRD: GitHub Actions Workflows for MeshHook

## Overview

This PRD outlines the integration of GitHub Actions workflows into the MeshHook project, aiming to automate continuous integration (CI) and continuous deployment (CD) processes. This addition is crucial for enhancing development efficiency, enforcing code quality, and streamlining deployment practices. Aligning with MeshHook's commitment to robustness and ease of maintenance, the GitHub Actions workflows will automate tests, linting, and deployments, facilitating a more agile and error-resistant development cycle.

## Objectives

- Automate the CI/CD pipeline to enhance development efficiency.
- Ensure high standards of code quality and security through automated testing and linting.
- Facilitate seamless and error-resistant deployments to staging and production environments.

## Functional Requirements

1. **CI Workflow:**
   - Automatically trigger on every push to `main` and upon pull request creation against `main`.
   - Execute all unit and integration tests to validate code changes.
   - Perform code linting to ensure adherence to coding standards.
   - Run a build process to verify that the application can be built without errors.

2. **CD Workflow:**
   - Trigger upon every merge into `main` to deploy changes to a staging environment automatically.
   - Perform smoke testing in the staging environment to confirm the deployment's success without disrupting service.
   - Require manual approval for deploying the application to the production environment, ensuring a controlled release process.

3. **Security Scan Workflow:**
   - Run static code analysis tools weekly and allow for manual triggers to identify security vulnerabilities.
   - Configure alerts to notify the development team of any detected vulnerabilities, facilitating prompt remediation.

## Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** Ensure CI workflows complete within 5 minutes to minimize disruptions to development workflows.
- **Reliability:** Incorporate error handling within workflows to gracefully manage and recover from transient errors.
- **Security:** Utilize GitHub encrypted secrets to manage sensitive information securely, preventing unauthorized access.
- **Maintainability:** Write modular and well-documented workflow configurations to simplify future updates and maintenance efforts.

## Technical Specifications

### Architecture Context

MeshHook operates on a microservices architecture, leveraging SvelteKit/Svelte 5 for frontend operations, Supabase for backend functionalities, and dedicated workers for task processing. The GitHub Actions workflows must integrate seamlessly with this setup to automate the CI/CD pipeline efficiently.

### Implementation Approach

1. **GitHub Actions Initialization:**
   - Create a `.github/workflows` directory in the MeshHook repository.
   - Add YAML configuration files to define the specifics of the CI, CD, and Security workflows.

2. **CI Workflow Configuration:**
   - Define jobs for linting, testing, and building the MeshHook application.
   - Optionally, utilize matrix strategies for testing across different operating environments or configurations.

3. **CD Workflow Configuration:**
   - Employ GitHub environments for differentiated handling of staging and production deployments.
   - Use environment-specific secrets to secure deployment processes.
   - Incorporate manual approval gates before production deployments to ensure deliberate release management.

4. **Security Workflow Configuration:**
   - Integrate static analysis tools (e.g., CodeQL, SonarCloud) for identifying security vulnerabilities.
   - Set up notifications for the development team on the discovery of any vulnerabilities.

### Data Model and API Changes

- No changes to the existing data model or API endpoints are required for the implementation of GitHub Actions workflows.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] CI workflow triggers successfully for all pushes and pull requests against `main`, completing tests, linting, and build processes without errors.
- [ ] CD workflow reliably deploys the application to the staging environment post-merge into `main` and supports manual triggers for production deployments.
- [ ] Security scanning workflow runs as scheduled and upon demand, effectively identifying and alerting on potential vulnerabilities.
- [ ] Documentation accurately reflects the CI/CD processes, including steps for addressing workflow failures.

## Dependencies and Prerequisites

- Administrator access to the MeshHook GitHub repository to set up and configure GitHub Actions.
- Existing suites of unit and integration tests for automated execution.
- Configured staging and production environments suitable for deployment processes.

## Implementation Notes

### Development Guidelines

- Follow GitHub's best practices for action versioning to ensure workflow stability.
- Keep workflow configurations simple and modular, facilitating ease of maintenance and future enhancements.

### Testing Strategy

- Conduct tests of the workflows by making minor changes in a separate branch and observing the execution outcomes.
- Confirm that workflow failures appropriately block merges to safeguard code quality and operational stability.

### Security Considerations

- Securely manage sensitive information, such as deployment credentials, using GitHub's encrypted secrets feature.
- Regularly review and update the versions of actions used to mitigate risks associated with vulnerabilities in dependencies.

### Monitoring and Observability

- Utilize GitHub Actions' built-in monitoring tools to track workflow execution times and success rates.
- Configure immediate notifications for workflow failures to ensure prompt issue resolution.
