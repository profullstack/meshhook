# PRD: GitHub Actions workflows

**Issue:** [#205](https://github.com/profullstack/meshhook/issues/205)  
**Milestone:** Phase 9: Deployment & Operations  
**Labels:** cicd, hacktoberfest  
**Phase:** Phase 9  
**Section:** CI/CD  

---

## Overview

This task is aimed at establishing and optimizing GitHub Actions workflows to automate the continuous integration (CI) and continuous deployment (CD) processes for MeshHook. By integrating GitHub Actions, we aim to streamline the development cycle, ensuring that code changes are automatically tested and deployed, thus aligning with MeshHook's goal of delivering a robust, scalable, and easy-to-maintain webhook-first workflow engine.

The GitHub Actions workflows will be designed to support MeshHook's core features, including webhook triggers, visual DAG builder, durable runs, live logs, and multi-tenant RLS security, by ensuring that all integrations and functionalities are continuously validated against our suite of automated tests and deployment pipelines.

## Functional Requirements

1. **CI Workflow:**
   - Automatically trigger on every push to `main` and pull request creation against `main`.
   - Run all unit and integration tests.
   - Validate coding standards and linting.
   - Build the project to ensure no build errors.
2. **CD Workflow:**
   - Trigger on every merge into `main`.
   - Deploy the application to the staging environment.
   - Run smoke tests against the staging environment.
   - Manual trigger for production deployment after staging validation.
3. **Security Scanning Workflow:**
   - Schedule to run weekly and on demand.
   - Include static code analysis to identify security vulnerabilities.
   - Alert the team on discovery of vulnerabilities.

## Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** Workflows must execute within acceptable time frames to not hinder development speed (preferably under 5 minutes for CI workflows).
- **Reliability:** Workflows must be configured with proper error handling to gracefully recover from transient errors where possible.
- **Security:** Use GitHub's encrypted secrets for storing sensitive information required for workflows (e.g., deployment credentials).

## Technical Specifications

### Architecture Context

MeshHook utilizes a microservices architecture pattern with components orchestrated through SvelteKit/Svelte 5 for frontend, Supabase for backend services, and various workers for processing tasks. GitHub Actions workflows should integrate seamlessly with this existing setup, providing automated testing, building, and deployment processes.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Setup GitHub Actions in the Repository:**
   - Create a new `.github/workflows` directory.
   - Add separate YAML configuration files for CI, CD, and Security workflows.
2. **CI Workflow Configuration:**
   - Define jobs for linting, testing, and building.
   - Utilize matrix strategy for testing across different environments if necessary.
3. **CD Workflow Configuration:**
   - Leverage GitHub environments for managing staging and production deployments.
   - Implement environment-specific secrets for secure deployments.
   - Setup manual review/approval steps for production deployment.
4. **Security Workflow Configuration:**
   - Integrate a static code analysis tool (e.g., CodeQL, SonarCloud).
   - Configure alerting for found vulnerabilities.

### Data Model

No data model changes are required for this task.

### API Endpoints

N/A

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] CI workflow successfully triggers on push/PR, executing all tests, lint checks, and build processes.
- [ ] CD workflow correctly deploys to staging on merge into `main` and supports manual production deployment.
- [ ] Security scanning workflow is set up to run on the schedule and identifies any potential vulnerabilities.
- [ ] Documentation is updated to reflect CI/CD processes and how to handle workflow failures.

## Dependencies

- Access permissions to the MeshHook GitHub repository for setting up GitHub Actions.
- Existing test suites and linting configurations.
- Staging and production environment setup for deployment.

## Implementation Notes

### Development Guidelines

- Follow GitHub's best practices for action versioning to ensure workflows are stable and up to date.
- Keep workflows as simple and modular as possible to facilitate maintenance and updates.

### Testing Strategy

- Validate workflows by making minor changes in a separate branch and observing the execution results.
- Ensure that the failure of workflows correctly blocks merges where applicable.

### Security Considerations

- Store all sensitive information such as deployment credentials in GitHub's encrypted secrets.
- Regularly review and update action versions to mitigate vulnerabilities from outdated dependencies.

### Monitoring & Observability

- Utilize GitHub Actions' built-in monitoring tools to track the execution time and outcomes of workflows.
- Set up notifications for workflow failures to promptly address any CI/CD pipeline issues.
