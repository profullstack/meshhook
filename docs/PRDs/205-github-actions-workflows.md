# PRD: GitHub Actions Workflows

**Issue:** [#205](https://github.com/profullstack/meshhook/issues/205)  
**Milestone:** Phase 9: Deployment & Operations  
**Labels:** cicd, hacktoberfest  
**Phase:** Phase 9  
**Section:** CI/CD  

---

## Overview

The introduction of GitHub Actions workflows into the MeshHook project infrastructure aims to automate continuous integration (CI) and continuous deployment (CD) processes. This initiative is designed to streamline the development lifecycle, from code integration, testing, to deployment, aligning with MeshHook's goal to provide a robust, efficient, and secure workflow engine.

**Objective:** Implement GitHub Actions workflows to automate CI/CD pipelines, enhancing project agility, reliability, and maintainability.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

1. **CI Workflow:** Automatically trigger builds on push events to the `main` branch and pull requests targeting `main`.
2. **CD Workflow:** Automate deployment to staging and production environments on successful CI runs against the `main` branch.
3. **Testing:** Integrate automated testing within CI workflows, ensuring all tests pass before allowing merges into `main`.
4. **Notifications:** Implement workflow failure notifications to the development team.

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** Ensure workflows are optimized for speed, minimizing build and deployment times.
- **Reliability:** Workflows must be reliable, with clear error handling and retry mechanisms for flaky operations.
- **Security:** Secure handling of secrets and credentials within workflows.
- **Maintainability:** Workflow configurations should be clear, well-documented, and easy to update.

## Technical Specifications

### Architecture Context

MeshHook leverages SvelteKit for its frontend and Supabase for backend services, including Postgres and Realtime functionalities. The GitHub Actions workflows need to integrate seamlessly with these technologies, ensuring a smooth CI/CD pipeline from code push to deployment.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Analysis:** Evaluate the current project setup to determine the best integration points for GitHub Actions.
2. **Workflow Design:** Define the steps for CI (build, test) and CD (deploy to staging/production) workflows.
3. **Secrets Management:** Use GitHub Secrets for managing sensitive information required by the workflows.
4. **Workflow Configuration:** Create `.github/workflows` directory and add YAML configuration files for each workflow.
5. **Testing and Iteration:** Test workflows with dummy commits and pull requests, iterating based on the results.
6. **Documentation:** Document the workflow setup and any project-specific configurations in the project's README or a dedicated documentation file.

### Data Model Changes

Not applicable for this task.

### API Endpoints (if applicable)

Not applicable for this task.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] CI workflow triggers on push to `main` and PRs targeting `main`.
- [ ] CD workflow deploys successfully to staging and production environments.
- [ ] Automated tests are executed, and results are visible in PR checks.
- [ ] Workflow failure notifications are set up and tested.
- [ ] Workflow execution times are optimized for performance.
- [ ] All workflow configurations are documented.

## Dependencies and Prerequisites

- Access to the MeshHook GitHub repository with sufficient permissions to manage GitHub Actions.
- Existing test suites and deployment scripts that can be integrated into the workflows.

## Implementation Notes

### Development Guidelines

- Follow the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle to minimize redundancy in workflow configurations.
- Use GitHub Actions' matrix strategy for running tests across multiple environments or versions if applicable.

### Testing Strategy

- Implement mock deployments to validate the CD workflow without affecting production.
- Utilize GitHub Actions' `workflow_dispatch` event for manual triggering of workflows during the testing phase.

### Security Considerations

- Use GitHub Secrets for storing sensitive information (API keys, credentials) and reference them in workflow files.
- Implement least privilege access principles, ensuring that the GitHub Actions token and any deployed services have only the permissions necessary to perform their tasks.

### Monitoring and Observability

- Utilize GitHub Actions' built-in job summaries and annotations to provide insights into workflow executions.
- Monitor deployment logs and metrics in target environments (staging/production) to ensure successful releases.
