# PRD: GitHub Actions Workflows for MeshHook

## Overview

The integration of GitHub Actions workflows into the MeshHook project represents a strategic enhancement aimed at automating the continuous integration (CI) and continuous deployment (CD) processes. This initiative is designed to streamline the development lifecycle, enhancing productivity, and ensuring high standards of code quality and security. By harnessing GitHub Actions, MeshHook aspires to automate testing, linting, and deployment processes, thereby facilitating a more efficient and error-free development workflow. This integration is pivotal for maintaining the robustness, scalability, and ease of maintenance that MeshHook aims to deliver, resonating with its core features like webhook triggers, visual DAG builder, durable runs, live logs, and multi-tenant RLS security.

## Functional Requirements

1. **CI Workflow:**
   - Trigger automatically on every push to `main` and on pull request creation against `main`.
   - Execute all unit and integration tests.
   - Perform code linting and validate coding standards.
   - Complete a build process to verify the absence of build errors.
2. **CD Workflow:**
   - Activate on every merge into `main`.
   - Facilitate the deployment of the application to a staging environment.
   - Conduct smoke tests within the staging environment to ensure deployment integrity.
   - Enable manual triggering for production deployment upon successful staging validation.
3. **Security Scan Workflow:**
   - Schedule to run weekly, with the option for on-demand execution.
   - Implement static code analysis to detect security vulnerabilities.
   - Configure to alert the development team upon the identification of vulnerabilities.

## Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** CI workflows should execute within 5 minutes to optimize developer productivity.
- **Reliability:** Workflows must include robust error handling mechanisms to manage transient errors effectively.
- **Security:** Securely manage sensitive information, such as deployment credentials, using GitHub's encrypted secrets.
- **Maintainability:** Code should be modular and well-documented to facilitate easy updates and maintenance.

## Technical Specifications

### Architecture Context

MeshHook employs a microservices architecture with a frontend powered by SvelteKit/Svelte 5, backend functionalities provided by Supabase, and various workers handling task processing. The GitHub Actions workflows need to be seamlessly integrated with this architecture to automate testing, building, and deployment processes efficiently.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Initialize GitHub Actions:**
   - Create the `.github/workflows` directory within the repository.
   - Add YAML files to define the CI, CD, and Security workflows.
2. **Configure CI Workflow:**
   - Setup jobs for linting, testing, and building the application.
   - If necessary, use a matrix strategy to test across multiple environments.
3. **Configure CD Workflow:**
   - Utilize GitHub environments to manage deployments to staging and production.
   - Secure deployments with environment-specific secrets.
   - Implement manual approval steps for production deployments.
4. **Configure Security Scanning:**
   - Integrate a tool for static code analysis, such as CodeQL or SonarCloud.
   - Setup notifications for any discovered vulnerabilities.

### Data Model

This task requires no changes to the existing data model.

### API Endpoints

N/A

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] CI workflow successfully triggers for push/PR events, running all tests, linting, and building processes.
- [ ] CD workflow accurately deploys the application to staging following merges into `main` and allows for manual production deployment.
- [ ] Security scanning workflow is operational as per the schedule and effectively identifies potential vulnerabilities.
- [ ] Documentation adequately reflects the CI/CD processes, including handling workflow failures.

## Dependencies

- Administrator access to the MeshHook GitHub repository to configure GitHub Actions.
- Pre-existing suites of unit and integration tests.
- Established staging and production environments for deployment processes.

## Implementation Notes

### Development Guidelines

- Adhere to GitHub's action versioning best practices to maintain workflow stability.
- Maintain simplicity and modularity in workflow configurations to ease future maintenance.

### Testing Strategy

- Test workflows by implementing minor changes in a separate branch and monitoring execution outcomes.
- Ensure workflow failures correctly prevent merges as intended.

### Security Considerations

- Utilize GitHub's encrypted secrets for managing sensitive information like deployment credentials.
- Regularly update action versions to address vulnerabilities associated with outdated dependencies.

### Monitoring & Observability

- Employ GitHub Actions' built-in tools for monitoring workflow execution times and outcomes.
- Configure notifications for workflow failures to promptly address issues.
