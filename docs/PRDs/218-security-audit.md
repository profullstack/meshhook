# PRD: Security Audit for MeshHook

**Issue:** [#218](https://github.com/profullstack/meshhook/issues/218)  
**Milestone:** Phase 10: Polish & Launch  
**Labels:** launch-prep, hacktoberfest

## Overview

This PRD outlines the requirements and approach for conducting a comprehensive security audit on MeshHook. MeshHook is a webhook-first, deterministic, Postgres-native workflow engine designed to combine the simplicity of n8n with the durability of Temporal, without the constraints of restrictive licensing. As we approach the launch phase, ensuring the security of our application is paramount. This audit aims to identify and mitigate potential vulnerabilities, ensuring MeshHook's reliability, security, and performance remain uncompromised.

### Objectives

- To conduct a thorough security assessment of MeshHook's architecture, codebase, and deployment infrastructure.
- To identify vulnerabilities and provide actionable recommendations for mitigation.
- To reinforce MeshHook's security posture before its official launch.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

1. **Security Audit Scope Definition:** Clearly define the boundaries of the security audit, including codebase components, deployment infrastructure, and third-party integrations.
2. **Vulnerability Assessment:** Perform automated and manual testing to identify security vulnerabilities within the application.
3. **Penetration Testing:** Simulate real-world attack scenarios to identify potential entry points and security weaknesses.
4. **Audit Reporting:** Document findings, including the severity of vulnerabilities, potential impacts, and recommendations for mitigation.
5. **Mitigation Plan Development:** Develop a prioritized action plan to address identified security vulnerabilities.

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** Ensure that security measures do not adversely affect the application's performance.
- **Reliability:** Implement security fixes in a manner that maintains or enhances system reliability.
- **Security:** Adhere to industry-standard security practices and guidelines throughout the audit process.
- **Maintainability:** Ensure that security enhancements are implemented in a maintainable manner, with consideration for future updates and modifications.

## Technical Specifications

### Architecture Context

MeshHook leverages a microservices architecture built on SvelteKit (SSR/API) for front-end interactions, Supabase for backend services (including Postgres, Realtime, and Storage), and dedicated workers for orchestration and HTTP execution. The security audit will need to encompass all aspects of this architecture, from individual code modules to external service configurations.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Preparation:**
   - Define the audit's scope and objectives.
   - Inventory all components, services, and dependencies subject to review.
2. **Automated Scanning:**
   - Utilize industry-standard tools (e.g., OWASP ZAP, SonarQube) to perform automated vulnerability scans.
3. **Manual Testing and Review:**
   - Conduct manual code reviews focusing on security hotspots.
   - Perform penetration testing to simulate attack scenarios.
4. **Report Generation:**
   - Compile findings into a detailed audit report.
   - Prioritize issues based on severity and potential impact.
5. **Mitigation Planning:**
   - Develop a mitigation plan, outlining corrective actions, responsible parties, and timelines.
6. **Implementation and Verification:**
   - Implement security fixes based on the mitigation plan.
   - Perform follow-up testing to verify the effectiveness of implemented measures.

### Data Model and API Endpoints

No new data model changes or API endpoints are required specifically for the security audit task. However, findings from the audit may necessitate future modifications, which should be documented accordingly.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] The scope of the security audit is clearly defined and agreed upon.
- [ ] Automated vulnerability scans are completed, with findings documented.
- [ ] Manual testing and code review are conducted, with vulnerabilities identified and documented.
- [ ] A comprehensive audit report is produced, detailing findings and recommendations.
- [ ] A prioritized mitigation plan is developed and approved.
- [ ] Security enhancements are implemented, addressing key vulnerabilities.
- [ ] Follow-up testing confirms the effectiveness of the security measures.
- [ ] No critical vulnerabilities remain unaddressed at the conclusion of the audit.

## Dependencies

- Access to all source code repositories and deployment environments.
- Availability of security testing tools and platforms.
- Cooperation from the development and operations teams for insights and access.

## Implementation Notes

### Development Guidelines

- Follow secure coding practices, emphasizing input validation, output encoding, and error handling.
- Adhere to the principle of least privilege in code and infrastructure.

### Testing Strategy

- Utilize a combination of automated scanning tools and manual testing techniques.
- Conduct regression testing to ensure security fixes do not introduce new vulnerabilities.

### Security Considerations

- All findings and vulnerabilities should be treated with confidentiality until mitigated.
- Implement encryption for data at rest and in transit where not already in place.
- Ensure secure defaults and configurations for all services and components.

### Monitoring & Observability

- Enhance monitoring and logging mechanisms to detect and alert on security anomalies.
- Implement or refine audit logging, particularly for sensitive operations and data access.
