# PRD: Comprehensive Security Audit for MeshHook

## Overview

The purpose of this PRD is to guide the comprehensive security audit of MeshHook, a webhook-first, deterministic, Postgres-native workflow engine. This audit is aligned with MeshHook's final preparation phase before its launch, ensuring that the platform is secure, reliable, and adheres to the best security practices. The audit is crucial for identifying potential vulnerabilities and compliance gaps, thus reinforcing MeshHook's commitment to delivering a trustworthy and efficient workflow automation platform.

## Functional Requirements

1. **Comprehensive Security Review**: Conduct a thorough security review covering the entire MeshHook stack, including its webhook triggers, visual DAG builder, event sourcing, multi-tenant RLS security, and live log functionalities.

2. **Vulnerability Identification**: Identify vulnerabilities within the MeshHook project using both automated tools and manual inspection methods. This includes reviewing the source code, dependencies, database configuration, and the deployment environment.

3. **Penetration Testing**: Execute penetration tests against all components of MeshHook to identify potential vulnerabilities from an attacker's perspective, including but not limited to the API endpoints, web application, and database layers.

4. **Compliance Verification**: Ensure MeshHook's compliance with relevant security standards and regulations, evaluating the platform's data handling practices, encryption standards, and access controls.

5. **Security Best Practices Validation**: Validate MeshHook's architecture and implementation against industry security best practices, with a focus on secure coding practices, secure communication protocols, and data protection mechanisms.

## Non-functional Requirements

- **Performance**: Ensure that security measures do not degrade the performance of the MeshHook platform.
- **Reliability**: Enhance system reliability by protecting against vulnerabilities that could lead to unauthorized access or data breaches.
- **Security**: Establish and maintain a robust security posture that protects against threats and vulnerabilities.
- **Maintainability**: Ensure that security implementations are maintainable, documented, and seamlessly integrate with MeshHookâ€™s existing architecture.

## Technical Specifications

### Architecture Considerations

- **Microservices Architecture**: Given MeshHook's use of a microservices architecture, the audit must evaluate the security of inter-service communications, service isolation, and potential points of failure.
- **SvelteKit/Svelte 5**: Review the security measures in place for the frontend application, including XSS protection, CSRF prevention, and secure handling of session information.
- **Supabase Realtime**: Ensure secure configuration and use of Supabase for real-time database operations, focusing on data access controls and data transmission security.
- **Event Sourcing**: Validate the security and integrity of the event sourcing mechanism, particularly in terms of event data handling and storage.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Scope Definition**: Clearly define the scope of the audit to cover all aspects of MeshHook, including its infrastructure, application, and data layers.
   
2. **Tool Selection**: Choose appropriate tools for static and dynamic analysis, dependency scanning, and penetration testing tailored to MeshHook's technology stack.

3. **Security Review and Testing**:
   - Perform static application security testing (SAST) to identify issues in source code.
   - Conduct dynamic application security testing (DAST) to find runtime vulnerabilities.
   - Use software composition analysis (SCA) tools to detect vulnerabilities in third-party dependencies.
   - Execute manual and automated penetration tests against the platform.

4. **Compliance and Best Practices Assessment**:
   - Evaluate MeshHook against applicable security standards (e.g., OWASP Top 10, GDPR).
   - Assess the implementation of security headers, encryption protocols, and authentication mechanisms.

5. **Remediation and Follow-up**:
   - Prioritize identified vulnerabilities based on their severity and impact.
   - Develop and implement a remediation plan.
   - Perform a follow-up audit to verify the effectiveness of the remediation efforts.

### Data Model and API Endpoint Evaluation

- **Data Encryption**: Ensure that sensitive data within the database is encrypted at rest and that encryption keys are securely managed.
- **API Security**: Review all API endpoints for security vulnerabilities such as injection attacks, improper authentication, and sensitive data exposure. Implement rate limiting and scrutinize API authentication and authorization mechanisms.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All components of MeshHook have been thoroughly reviewed for security vulnerabilities.
- [ ] Identified vulnerabilities are documented, with their impact and severity evaluated.
- [ ] Remediation strategies are provided for all identified vulnerabilities.
- [ ] Critical vulnerabilities are addressed, with changes validated through subsequent testing.
- [ ] MeshHook complies with recognized security best practices and regulatory standards.
- [ ] Security enhancements and practices are well-documented.

## Dependencies

- Access to MeshHook's full codebase and infrastructure configurations.
- Security analysis and penetration testing tools suitable for MeshHook's technology stack.
- Collaboration with MeshHook's development and operations teams.

## Implementation Notes

### Development Guidelines

- Adhere to secure coding guidelines, focusing on validation, encoding, and secure error handling.
- Regularly update dependencies to incorporate security patches.

### Testing Strategy

- Integrate automated security testing into the CI/CD pipeline to identify vulnerabilities early.
- Conduct comprehensive manual penetration testing to uncover more complex security issues.

### Security Considerations

- Ensure encryption of sensitive data both in transit and at rest.
- Enforce strict access control and permission management practices.
- Regularly audit and rotate cryptographic keys and secrets.

### Monitoring and Observability

- Implement real-time monitoring and alerting for security incidents and anomalies.
- Utilize logging to monitor access and changes to sensitive data and operations.

By adhering to this PRD, MeshHook aims to achieve a high standard of security, thereby ensuring the trust and safety of its user base upon launch.
