# PRD: Security Audit for MeshHook

## Overview

<<<<<<< HEAD
The purpose of this task is to conduct a comprehensive security audit for the MeshHook project. This audit is crucial for ensuring that MeshHook provides a secure, scalable, and efficient workflow engine. As we approach the launch phase, it is vital to identify and mitigate any security vulnerabilities to protect against potential threats. This task aligns with MeshHook's core objectives by emphasizing the importance of security in delivering a reliable workflow automation solution.

## Functional Requirements

1. **Conduct a Comprehensive Security Review:** Evaluate the MeshHook codebase, architecture, and third-party dependencies to identify potential vulnerabilities.
2. **Penetration Testing:** Perform systematic attempts to breach the security of the MeshHook system in various ways to uncover vulnerabilities.
3. **Security Best Practices Assessment:** Assess the project’s adherence to recognized security best practices and standards (e.g., OWASP).
4. **Dependency Security Analysis:** Review all third-party dependencies for known security vulnerabilities and ensure they are up to date.
5. **Compliance Verification:** Verify compliance with relevant security standards and regulations applicable to the MeshHook project.

## Non-functional Requirements

- **Performance:** Ensure that security measures do not degrade performance beyond acceptable thresholds.
- **Reliability:** Security enhancements must contribute to the overall reliability and stability of the MeshHook system.
- **Security:** Implement comprehensive security measures that align with industry best practices.
- **Maintainability:** Security implementations should be maintainable, documented, and align with the project’s existing patterns.
=======
The security audit task is a critical component of the MeshHook project's Phase 10: Polish & Launch. As MeshHook aims to provide a secure, efficient, and scalable workflow engine that leverages webhooks, visual DAG building, and event sourcing, ensuring that these capabilities are delivered within a secure framework is paramount. This task will focus on scrutinizing the existing architecture, codebase, and operational practices to identify and mitigate potential security vulnerabilities.

**Objective:** Conduct a comprehensive security audit to identify vulnerabilities, enforce best practices, and ensure compliance with security standards, thereby aligning with MeshHook's goals of providing secure, reliable, and efficient workflow automation solutions.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

1. **Security Vulnerability Assessment:** Identify security vulnerabilities in the codebase and infrastructure.
2. **Security Best Practices Review:** Evaluate the project against security best practices and industry standards.
3. **Penetration Testing:** Simulate cyber-attacks to identify potential points of failure.
4. **Dependency Analysis:** Review third-party dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
5. **Compliance Check:** Ensure the project meets relevant security compliance standards (e.g., OWASP Top 10).

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** The security measures implemented should not significantly degrade system performance.
- **Reliability:** Enhanced security mechanisms should contribute to the overall system reliability.
- **Security:** Implementation of robust security measures to protect against vulnerabilities.
- **Maintainability:** Security enhancements should be documented and maintainable.

## Technical Specifications

### Architecture Context

<<<<<<< HEAD
MeshHook utilizes a microservices architecture with SvelteKit for the frontend, Supabase for database operations and real-time updates, and dedicated worker services for process orchestration. The security audit will need to cover these areas, focusing on potential integration vulnerabilities, data protection, and the security of communications between services.
=======
MeshHook utilizes a robust architecture comprising SvelteKit for SSR/API, Supabase for database and real-time operations, and dedicated workers for orchestration and HTTP execution. The security audit needs to consider each component's specific security implications and integration points.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Preparation:**
<<<<<<< HEAD
   - Compile a list of all components, libraries, and services used by MeshHook.
   - Define the security audit scope, including all external and internal interfaces.

2. **Execution:**
   - Static code analysis to detect vulnerabilities, coding flaws, and adherence to security best practices.
   - Dynamic analysis and penetration testing to identify runtime vulnerabilities.
   - Dependency check to find vulnerabilities in third-party libraries and frameworks.
   - Review authentication, authorization, and encryption implementations.
   - Analyze data storage and transmission for potential PII data exposure.

3. **Reporting:**
   - Document all findings with severity ratings and potential impact.
   - Propose mitigation strategies for each identified vulnerability.
=======
   - Assemble a security audit team with expertise in SvelteKit, Supabase, Postgres, and general web security.
   - Define the scope of the audit, including all components and third-party services.

2. **Execution:**
   - Conduct static code analysis to identify potential security issues.
   - Perform penetration testing to uncover vulnerabilities.
   - Review the use of third-party dependencies and libraries for known vulnerabilities.
   - Assess the implementation of RLS and secrets management for adequacy.
   - Evaluate audit logs, PII handling, and compliance with security best practices.

3. **Reporting:**
   - Document findings, including identified vulnerabilities and their severity.
   - Provide recommendations for mitigating identified risks.

4. **Remediation:**
   - Prioritize the implementation of fixes based on the severity and impact of vulnerabilities.
   - Update documentation to reflect any changes made to the system architecture or code.

5. **Review and Continuous Improvement:**
   - Conduct a follow-up review to ensure all vulnerabilities have been addressed.
   - Establish a routine for regular security assessments and updates.
