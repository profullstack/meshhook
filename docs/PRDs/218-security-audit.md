# PRD: Security Audit for MeshHook

## Overview

The security audit task is a critical component of the MeshHook project's Phase 10: Polish & Launch. As MeshHook aims to provide a secure, efficient, and scalable workflow engine that leverages webhooks, visual DAG building, and event sourcing, ensuring that these capabilities are delivered within a secure framework is paramount. This task will focus on scrutinizing the existing architecture, codebase, and operational practices to identify and mitigate potential security vulnerabilities.

**Objective:** Conduct a comprehensive security audit to identify vulnerabilities, enforce best practices, and ensure compliance with security standards, thereby aligning with MeshHook's goals of providing secure, reliable, and efficient workflow automation solutions.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

1. **Security Vulnerability Assessment:** Identify security vulnerabilities in the codebase and infrastructure.
2. **Security Best Practices Review:** Evaluate the project against security best practices and industry standards.
3. **Penetration Testing:** Simulate cyber-attacks to identify potential points of failure.
4. **Dependency Analysis:** Review third-party dependencies for known vulnerabilities.
5. **Compliance Check:** Ensure the project meets relevant security compliance standards (e.g., OWASP Top 10).

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** The security measures implemented should not significantly degrade system performance.
- **Reliability:** Enhanced security mechanisms should contribute to the overall system reliability.
- **Security:** Implementation of robust security measures to protect against vulnerabilities.
- **Maintainability:** Security enhancements should be documented and maintainable.

## Technical Specifications

### Architecture Context

MeshHook utilizes a robust architecture comprising SvelteKit for SSR/API, Supabase for database and real-time operations, and dedicated workers for orchestration and HTTP execution. The security audit needs to consider each component's specific security implications and integration points.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Preparation:**
   - Assemble a security audit team with expertise in SvelteKit, Supabase, Postgres, and general web security.
   - Define the scope of the audit, including all components and third-party services.

2. **Execution:**
   - Conduct static code analysis to identify potential security issues.
   - Perform penetration testing to uncover vulnerabilities.
   - Review the use of third-party dependencies and libraries for known vulnerabilities.
   - Assess the implementation of RLS and secrets management for adequacy.
   - Evaluate audit logs, PII handling, and compliance with security best practices.

3. **Reporting:**
   - Document findings, including identified vulnerabilities and their severity.
   - Provide recommendations for mitigating identified risks.

4. **Remediation:**
   - Prioritize the implementation of fixes based on the severity and impact of vulnerabilities.
   - Update documentation to reflect any changes made to the system architecture or code.

5. **Review and Continuous Improvement:**
   - Conduct a follow-up review to ensure all vulnerabilities have been addressed.
   - Establish a routine for regular security assessments and updates.

### Data Model

No direct data model changes are anticipated for this task. However, modifications may be required based on the audit findings, especially in areas related to security, such as encryption methods or access controls.

### API Endpoints

No new API endpoints are anticipated for this task. However, existing endpoints may require enhancements or modifications to improve security based on audit findings.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All components of the MeshHook architecture have been audited for security vulnerabilities.
- [ ] Identified vulnerabilities have been classified by severity and documented.
- [ ] Recommendations for mitigating all identified risks have been provided.
- [ ] Critical and high-severity vulnerabilities have been addressed, and fixes have been verified.
- [ ] Compliance with relevant security standards and best practices has been achieved.
- [ ] Documentation has been updated to reflect any changes made during the remediation process.

## Dependencies

- Access to the full MeshHook codebase and infrastructure configuration.
- Tools and services for static code analysis, penetration testing, and dependency checking.
- Expertise in the specific technologies used by MeshHook (SvelteKit, Supabase, Postgres).

## Implementation Notes

### Development Guidelines

- Follow secure coding practices, including input validation, output encoding, and proper error handling.
- Use the latest versions of tools and libraries to benefit from recent security improvements.

### Testing Strategy

- Implement automated security testing as part of the CI/CD pipeline.
- Conduct manual testing for complex security scenarios not covered by automated tests.

### Security Considerations

- Ensure that all data is encrypted in transit and at rest.
- Implement stringent access controls and permission checks.
- Regularly rotate encryption keys and secrets.

### Monitoring & Observability

- Enhance monitoring to detect and alert on potential security incidents.
- Utilize logging to track access and changes to sensitive data and operations.
