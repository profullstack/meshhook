# PRD: Security Audit for MeshHook

## Overview

The MeshHook project is approaching its launch phase, necessitating a thorough security audit to ensure the integrity, privacy, and reliability of its operations. Given MeshHook's innovative approach to workflow automation, leveraging webhook triggers, a visual DAG builder, and a multi-tenant architecture, it is critical to identify and rectify any security vulnerabilities that could undermine user trust or system functionality. This audit aligns with MeshHook's core objectives of delivering a secure, efficient, and user-friendly workflow automation platform.

## Functional Requirements

1. **Security Review:** Conduct a detailed security review of MeshHook's codebase, including its architecture and third-party dependencies, to identify security vulnerabilities.
2. **Penetration Testing:** Execute comprehensive penetration testing across all components of MeshHook to discover vulnerabilities.
3. **Assessment of Security Practices:** Evaluate MeshHook's adherence to security best practices and standards, such as those recommended by OWASP.
4. **Dependency Analysis:** Perform a thorough analysis of third-party dependencies to detect known security issues, ensuring all components are up-to-date.
5. **Compliance Checks:** Ensure MeshHook's compliance with relevant security standards and regulations.

## Non-functional Requirements

- **Performance:** Security measures must be efficient, ensuring minimal impact on system performance.
- **Reliability:** Enhancements should bolster the system's reliability, preventing unauthorized access or data breaches.
- **Security:** Implement a comprehensive security framework that follows industry best practices.
- **Maintainability:** Ensure that security implementations are easily maintainable, well-documented, and consistent with MeshHook's existing architectural patterns.

## Technical Specifications

### Architecture Context

MeshHook employs a microservices architecture, using SvelteKit for frontend operations, Supabase for real-time data updates and database management, and dedicated worker services for task orchestration. The security audit should encompass these components, focusing on potential vulnerabilities in integration points, data security, and the encryption of communications between services.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Preparation:**
   - Catalog all MeshHook components, libraries, and services.
   - Define the audit's scope, covering external and internal interfaces.

2. **Execution:**
   - Conduct static code analysis to identify coding flaws, vulnerabilities, and deviations from security best practices.
   - Perform dynamic analysis and penetration testing to uncover runtime vulnerabilities.
   - Execute dependency checks for security vulnerabilities in third-party libraries and frameworks.
   - Review implementations of authentication, authorization, and encryption for adequacy.
   - Examine data storage and transmission protocols for potential exposure of personally identifiable information (PII).

3. **Reporting:**
   - Document findings, assigning severity ratings and detailing potential impacts.
   - Recommend mitigation strategies for each identified vulnerability.

4. **Remediation Plan:**
   - Prioritize vulnerabilities for remediation based on severity and impact.
   - Outline a timeline for vulnerability resolution.

5. **Validation:**
   - Re-evaluate the system to ensure vulnerabilities are effectively mitigated.
   - Revise documentation and practices to reflect security improvements.

### Data Model Changes

- Evaluate current data models' ability to secure sensitive and personal information, implementing encryption and access control modifications as necessary.

### API Endpoints

- Assess all API endpoints for vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, XSS, and insecure deserialization, with improvement recommendations included in the audit findings.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All security vulnerabilities within MeshHook identified.
- [ ] The severity of vulnerabilities documented.
- [ ] Remediation strategies for each vulnerability provided.
- [ ] Critical vulnerabilities addressed and fixes validated.
- [ ] Compliance with recognized security best practices and standards achieved.
- [ ] Documentation updated to reflect security practice improvements.

## Dependencies

- Complete access to the MeshHook code repository and related documentation.
- Security scanning and penetration testing tools.
- Collaboration from the development team for clarification and insight.

## Implementation Notes

### Development Guidelines

- Adhere to secure coding practices, particularly for input validation, output encoding, and error handling.
- Ensure all libraries and dependencies are updated to their latest stable versions.

### Testing Strategy

- Integrate automated security testing into the CI/CD pipeline.
- Conduct manual penetration testing for complex vulnerability scenarios.

### Security Considerations

- Secure sensitive data through encryption both at rest and in transit.
- Implement robust access controls and manage permissions diligently.
- Regularly rotate cryptographic keys and secrets.

### Monitoring & Observability

- Implement security anomaly detection and alerting systems.
- Utilize logging to monitor access to sensitive operations and data modifications.
