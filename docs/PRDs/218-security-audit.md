# PRD: Security Audit for MeshHook

## Overview

The purpose of this task is to conduct a comprehensive security audit for the MeshHook project. This audit is crucial for ensuring that MeshHook provides a secure, scalable, and efficient workflow engine. As we approach the launch phase, it is vital to identify and mitigate any security vulnerabilities to protect against potential threats. This task aligns with MeshHook's core objectives by emphasizing the importance of security in delivering a reliable workflow automation solution.

## Functional Requirements

1. **Conduct a Comprehensive Security Review:** Evaluate the MeshHook codebase, architecture, and third-party dependencies to identify potential vulnerabilities.
2. **Penetration Testing:** Perform systematic attempts to breach the security of the MeshHook system in various ways to uncover vulnerabilities.
3. **Security Best Practices Assessment:** Assess the project’s adherence to recognized security best practices and standards (e.g., OWASP).
4. **Dependency Security Analysis:** Review all third-party dependencies for known security vulnerabilities and ensure they are up to date.
5. **Compliance Verification:** Verify compliance with relevant security standards and regulations applicable to the MeshHook project.

## Non-functional Requirements

- **Performance:** Ensure that security measures do not degrade performance beyond acceptable thresholds.
- **Reliability:** Security enhancements must contribute to the overall reliability and stability of the MeshHook system.
- **Security:** Implement comprehensive security measures that align with industry best practices.
- **Maintainability:** Security implementations should be maintainable, documented, and align with the project’s existing patterns.

## Technical Specifications

### Architecture Context

MeshHook utilizes a microservices architecture with SvelteKit for the frontend, Supabase for database operations and real-time updates, and dedicated worker services for process orchestration. The security audit will need to cover these areas, focusing on potential integration vulnerabilities, data protection, and the security of communications between services.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Preparation:**
   - Compile a list of all components, libraries, and services used by MeshHook.
   - Define the security audit scope, including all external and internal interfaces.

2. **Execution:**
   - Static code analysis to detect vulnerabilities, coding flaws, and adherence to security best practices.
   - Dynamic analysis and penetration testing to identify runtime vulnerabilities.
   - Dependency check to find vulnerabilities in third-party libraries and frameworks.
   - Review authentication, authorization, and encryption implementations.
   - Analyze data storage and transmission for potential PII data exposure.

3. **Reporting:**
   - Document all findings with severity ratings and potential impact.
   - Propose mitigation strategies for each identified vulnerability.

4. **Remediation Plan:**
   - Prioritize vulnerabilities for remediation based on severity and potential impact.
   - Develop a timeline for addressing vulnerabilities.

5. **Validation:**
   - Retest to confirm that vulnerabilities have been effectively mitigated.
   - Update documentation and practices to incorporate security improvements.

### Data Model Changes

- Assess if current data models adequately protect sensitive and personal information with appropriate encryption and access controls. Any changes required will be documented and implemented as part of the remediation plan.

### API Endpoints

- Review all existing API endpoints for security vulnerabilities including but not limited to SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and insecure deserialization. Recommendations for improvements or changes will be part of the audit findings.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Security vulnerabilities within the MeshHook codebase, architecture, and third-party dependencies are identified.
- [ ] The severity of identified vulnerabilities is documented.
- [ ] Remediation strategies for each identified vulnerability are provided.
- [ ] Critical vulnerabilities are addressed, and fixes are validated.
- [ ] MeshHook complies with recognized security best practices and standards.
- [ ] Documentation is updated to reflect any changes or improvements in security practices.

## Dependencies

- Access to the MeshHook repository and all related documentation.
- Security scanning and penetration testing tools.
- Cooperation from the development team for insights and clarifications.

## Implementation Notes

### Development Guidelines

- Follow secure coding practices, especially for input validation, output encoding, and error handling.
- Update all libraries and dependencies to their latest stable versions.

### Testing Strategy

- Automated security testing integrated into the CI/CD pipeline.
- Manual penetration testing for complex attack scenarios.

### Security Considerations

- Ensure encryption of sensitive data at rest and in transit.
- Implement comprehensive access controls and permissions management.
- Regularly rotate cryptographic keys and secrets.

### Monitoring & Observability

- Implement monitoring to detect and alert on security anomalies.
- Use logging to track access to sensitive operations and data changes.
