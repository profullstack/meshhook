# PRD: Security Audit for MeshHook

## Overview

The objective of this Product Requirements Document (PRD) is to outline the necessary steps, requirements, and considerations for conducting a comprehensive security audit of the MeshHook project. As MeshHook nears its launch, ensuring the security integrity of its components—ranging from webhook triggers and visual DAG builders to its multi-tenant architecture—is paramount. This security audit aims to identify and mitigate potential vulnerabilities, thereby aligning with MeshHook's overarching goal of delivering a secure, efficient, and user-friendly workflow automation platform.

## Functional Requirements

1. **Security Review:** Conduct an exhaustive review of the MeshHook codebase, focusing on the architecture, third-party dependencies, and any potential security vulnerabilities.
2. **Penetration Testing:** Implement detailed penetration testing to simulate attacks on all facets of MeshHook, identifying vulnerabilities across the platform.
3. **Security Best Practices Assessment:** Evaluate MeshHook's current implementation against standard security best practices, particularly those outlined by OWASP, to identify areas of improvement.
4. **Dependency Analysis:** Perform a detailed analysis of third-party dependencies to uncover any known security vulnerabilities, ensuring that all components are up-to-date and secure.
5. **Regulatory Compliance Check:** Verify MeshHook's adherence to applicable security regulations and standards, ensuring full compliance.

## Non-functional Requirements

- **Performance:** Security implementations must not significantly impact the overall system performance, maintaining MeshHook's efficiency.
- **Reliability:** Security measures should enhance the system's reliability, protecting against unauthorized access and potential data breaches.
- **Security:** A comprehensive security framework, adhering to industry best practices, must be established and integrated within MeshHook.
- **Maintainability:** Security measures and implementations must be easily maintainable, well-documented, and in harmony with MeshHook's existing architectural design.

## Technical Specifications

### Architecture Considerations

MeshHook utilizes a microservices architecture, with SvelteKit powering the frontend, Supabase for real-time database operations, and dedicated worker services for task execution. The security audit must encompass these components, highlighting potential vulnerabilities in data security, communications encryption, and integration points.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Preparation:**
   - Catalogue MeshHook's components, libraries, and services.
   - Define the scope of the audit, including both external and internal interfaces.

2. **Execution:**
   - Utilize static code analysis tools to spot coding flaws, vulnerabilities, and non-adherence to security best practices.
   - Conduct dynamic analysis and penetration testing to identify runtime vulnerabilities.
   - Perform security checks on third-party libraries and frameworks for known vulnerabilities.
   - Assess the implementations of authentication, authorization, and encryption mechanisms.
   - Investigate data storage and transmission for potential PII exposure risks.

3. **Reporting:**
   - Document the findings, categorize the severity of vulnerabilities, and outline potential impacts.
   - Propose specific mitigation strategies for identified vulnerabilities.

4. **Remediation Plan:**
   - Prioritize vulnerabilities for immediate remediation based on their severity and potential impact.
   - Develop a timeline and roadmap for addressing vulnerabilities.

5. **Validation:**
   - Re-assess the system post-remediation to ensure all vulnerabilities have been effectively addressed.
   - Update documentation and best practices to reflect the enhanced security posture.

### Data Model Changes

- Reassess current data models for their capability to securely handle sensitive and personal data, applying necessary adjustments for encryption and access controls.

### API Endpoint Evaluation

- Thoroughly evaluate all API endpoints for vulnerabilities, such as SQL injection, XSS, and insecure deserialization, offering concrete recommendations for improvements within the audit findings.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Comprehensive identification of security vulnerabilities within MeshHook.
- [ ] Documentation of vulnerabilities' severity.
- [ ] Provision of remediation strategies for each identified vulnerability.
- [ ] Resolution and validation of critical vulnerabilities.
- [ ] Achievement of compliance with recognized security best practices and standards.
- [ ] Updated documentation reflecting improvements in security practices.

## Dependencies

- Access to the complete MeshHook code repository and related documentation.
- Utilization of security scanning and penetration testing tools.
- Collaboration with the development team for insights and clarifications.

## Implementation Notes

### Development Guidelines

- Follow secure coding practices, particularly regarding input validation, output encoding, and secure error handling.
- Ensure all dependencies are consistently updated to their latest stable versions.

### Testing Strategy

- Incorporate automated security testing within the CI/CD pipeline.
- Execute manual penetration testing to cover complex vulnerability scenarios.

### Security Considerations

- Encrypt sensitive data both at rest and in transit.
- Implement stringent access controls and diligently manage permissions.
- Regularly rotate cryptographic keys and manage secrets securely.

### Monitoring and Observability

- Implement systems for detecting security anomalies and setting up alerts.
- Use logging to track access to sensitive operations and modifications of data.
