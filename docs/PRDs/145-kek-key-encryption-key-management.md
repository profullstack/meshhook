# PRD: KEK (Key Encryption Key) Management System

## Overview

As part of MeshHook's Phase 4: Security enhancements, the KEK (Key Encryption Key) Management System is a fundamental project initiative aimed at bolstering the security framework of MeshHook. This system is designed to manage the lifecycle of encryption keys that secure sensitive data, such as user-defined secrets within workflows. By instituting a robust KEK management process, MeshHook aims to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of encrypted data across its multi-tenant environment, thereby reinforcing trust and security for its users.

### Objectives

- To implement a secure, efficient, and scalable KEK management system.
- To facilitate secure KEK generation, rotation, storage, and access control.
- To align MeshHook's encryption key management practices with industry standards and best practices.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

1. **KEK Generation:** Secure generation of KEKs, ensuring strong cryptographic properties.
2. **KEK Rotation:** Automated and manual rotation capabilities for KEKs to limit the lifespan of any given key and enhance security.
3. **Secure Storage:** Encryption of KEKs at rest, utilizing secure storage mechanisms to prevent unauthorized access.
4. **Access Control:** Implement fine-grained access control to KEKs, allowing only authorized entities to generate, rotate, or access KEKs.
5. **Audit Logging:** Comprehensive logging of all KEK-related operations to support auditability and traceability.

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** The KEK management system must operate with minimal latency and overhead, ensuring that encryption operations do not impede system performance.
- **Reliability:** The system must be fault-tolerant, ensuring continuous operation and data integrity even in the case of failures.
- **Security:** Utilization of best-in-class cryptographic standards and practices to safeguard against unauthorized access and potential security vulnerabilities.

## Technical Specifications

### Architecture Context

MeshHook's architecture comprises SvelteKit for frontend operations and Supabase for backend functionality, including database and real-time capabilities. The KEK management system will be seamlessly integrated into this existing architecture, with a particular emphasis on secure interactions with the Supabase-backed Postgres database for encrypted data storage.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Design KEK Storage Schema:** Update the Postgres schema to include a table dedicated to KEK storage, ensuring encrypted storage of KEKs themselves.
   
2. **KEK Generation and Storage:** Implement a backend service for the secure generation and storage of KEKs, utilizing cryptographic libraries recommended for node.js applications.
   
3. **KEK Rotation Process:** Design and implement a KEK rotation mechanism, which can be triggered manually or on a schedule, to re-encrypt data with new KEKs.
   
4. **Access Control and Audit Logging:** Leverage Supabase's built-in RLS and logging capabilities to implement access controls and logging for KEK operations.
   
5. **Documentation:** Update the project's documentation to include detailed descriptions of the KEK management system's architecture, API endpoints, and operational procedures.

### Data Model Changes

```sql
CREATE TABLE kek_storage (
    kek_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    kek_encrypted BYTEA NOT NULL,
    encryption_key_id INTEGER REFERENCES encryption_keys(id),
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    rotated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
    status VARCHAR(50) DEFAULT 'active' NOT NULL
);
```

### API Endpoints

- **POST /api/v1/kek/generate**: Endpoint to trigger the generation of a new KEK.
- **POST /api/v1/kek/rotate**: Endpoint to initiate the KEK rotation process.
- **GET /api/v1/kek/status**: Endpoint to retrieve the current status and metadata of KEKs.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Secure generation and storage of KEKs are implemented and demonstrable.
- KEK rotation functionality is fully implemented, with both manual and scheduled triggers.
- Access to KEKs is tightly controlled, with comprehensive audit logs available.
- Integration and unit tests cover new functionalities, ensuring reliability and security.
- Documentation is updated to accurately reflect the KEK management system's implementation.

## Dependencies

- Supabase for backend services.
- Cryptographic libraries compatible with Node.js.
- Existing MeshHook infrastructure and security protocols.

## Implementation Notes

### Development Guidelines

- Adhere to MeshHook's coding standards and practices.
- Employ a TDD approach to foster robust and reliable codebase enhancements.
- Ensure compatibility with the latest LTS version of Node.js and modern JavaScript features.

### Testing Strategy

- **Unit Testing:** Focus on testing the individual components of the KEK management system.
- **Integration Testing:** Ensure that the KEK system integrates seamlessly with the broader MeshHook platform, particularly with the encryption and storage of sensitive data.
- **Security Testing:** Conduct thorough security assessments to identify and mitigate potential vulnerabilities, focusing on encryption mechanisms and access control.

### Security Considerations

- The implementation must use cryptographic algorithms and key lengths that meet or exceed current industry standards.
- Access to KEKs should be strictly controlled, logged, and monitored to prevent unauthorized access.
- Regular security audits should be conducted to ensure the ongoing integrity of the KEK management system.

### Monitoring & Observability

- Integrate KEK management operations into MeshHookâ€™s existing monitoring systems to ensure visibility and prompt alerting on critical issues.
- Implement comprehensive logging for all KEK-related operations to support auditability and troubleshooting.

By adhering to these guidelines and specifications, the KEK Management System will significantly enhance the security posture of MeshHook, ensuring the secure management of encryption keys and the protection of sensitive data across the platform.
