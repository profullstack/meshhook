# PRD: KEK (Key Encryption Key) Management

**Issue:** [#145](https://github.com/profullstack/meshhook/issues/145)  
**Milestone:** Phase 4: Security  
**Labels:** secrets-encryption, hacktoberfest  
**Phase:** Phase 4  
**Section:** Secrets Encryption

---

## Overview

In the ongoing effort to enhance MeshHook's security, this PRD outlines the task of implementing a robust Key Encryption Key (KEK) management system. The KEK management system is crucial for securing the encryption keys used to encrypt and decrypt sensitive data, such as user secrets stored within the platform. This system aligns with MeshHook’s commitment to providing a secure, multi-tenant workflow engine environment. By implementing KEK management, MeshHook will ensure that all encrypted data remains secure, even in the event of a breach, by facilitating regular rotation and secure storage of KEKs.

### Objectives

- Securely manage the lifecycle of Key Encryption Keys (KEKs) used to encrypt secret data.
- Provide mechanisms for secure rotation, storage, and access to KEKs.
- Align with industry best practices for encryption key management to bolster MeshHook's security posture.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

1. **KEK Generation:** Ability to generate new KEKs securely.
2. **KEK Rotation:** Implement a process for rotating KEKs periodically without service interruption.
3. **Secure Storage:** Securely store KEKs, ensuring they are encrypted at rest.
4. **Access Control:** Restrict access to KEKs to only authorized services and personnel.
5. **Audit Logging:** Log all operations related to KEK management, including generation, rotation, and access.

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** KEK operations should not significantly impact the performance of the MeshHook platform.
- **Reliability:** Ensure KEK management processes are fault-tolerant and can recover from errors without data loss.
- **Security:** Adhere to industry-standard security practices for key management, including the use of secure cryptographic algorithms.

## Technical Specifications

### Architecture Context

MeshHook utilizes a combination of SvelteKit for frontend operations and Supabase for backend services, including database and real-time functionalities. The KEK management system will integrate closely with these existing components, particularly focusing on secure interactions with the database where encrypted data is stored.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Design KEK Storage Schema:** Update the `schema.sql` to include a new table for storing KEKs, their metadata, and encrypted forms.
2. **KEK Generation & Storage:** Implement a service module responsible for generating new KEKs and storing them securely in the database.
3. **KEK Rotation Process:** Develop a process (potentially a scheduled job) that handles the rotation of KEKs, including re-encrypting data with the new KEK.
4. **Access Control & Logging:** Ensure that only authorized services can access KEKs and that all access is logged for audit purposes.
5. **Update Documentation:** Document the KEK management system, including architecture changes, API endpoints, and operational procedures.

**Key Considerations:**

- KEKs must be stored in a manner that is encrypted at rest.
- Ensure backward compatibility during the KEK rotation process to avoid service disruption.
- Include error handling and recovery mechanisms throughout the KEK lifecycle management process.

### Data Model Changes

Addition of a `kek_storage` table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE kek_storage (
    kek_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    kek_encrypted BYTEA NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    rotated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
    status VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL
);
```

### API Endpoints

- `POST /api/v1/kek/rotate` - Initiates a KEK rotation process.
- `GET /api/v1/kek/status` - Retrieves the current status of KEKs, including the last rotation date.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] KEK generation and secure storage functionality implemented.
- [ ] KEK rotation process developed and tested.
- [ ] Access to KEK management features restricted and logged.
- [ ] All new code is covered by unit and integration tests.
- [ ] Documentation updated to reflect changes in the system.
- [ ] Security audit completed with no major issues reported.

## Dependencies

- Supabase for database and real-time functionality.
- Existing MeshHook infrastructure and services.

## Implementation Notes

### Development Guidelines

- Follow MeshHook's existing coding standards and best practices.
- Use TDD (Test Driven Development) approach for the development of new features.
- Ensure all new code is compatible with Node.js 20+ and uses ES2024+ features where applicable.

### Testing Strategy

- **Unit Testing:** For individual components and utilities related to KEK management.
- **Integration Testing:** To ensure KEK management processes interact correctly with other MeshHook components and services.
- **Security Testing:** Specifically focusing on the encryption, storage, and access control mechanisms of KEKs.

### Security Considerations

- Utilize AES-GCM for encryption tasks related to KEK storage.
- Implement strict access control and logging for all KEK management operations.
- Regularly audit the KEK management system for potential security issues.

### Monitoring & Observability

- Integrate KEK management operations into MeshHook’s existing monitoring systems.
- Set up alerts for critical KEK management operations and failures.

## Related Documentation

- Main PRD, Architecture, and Security Guidelines documents should be updated to reflect the introduction of KEK management features.
