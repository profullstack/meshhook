# PRD: Project Membership Management

**Issue:** [#142](https://github.com/profullstack/meshhook/issues/142)  
**Milestone:** Phase 4: Security  
**Labels:** authentication-authorization, hacktoberfest  
**Owner:** Anthony Ettinger (Profullstack)  
**License:** MIT  

## Overview

The Project Membership Management feature is a critical component of MeshHook's Phase 4 security enhancements. It is designed to manage user roles and permissions within projects, enabling fine-grained access control and ensuring that users can only access resources and execute operations according to their roles. This feature aligns with MeshHook's goals by enhancing security, ensuring multi-tenant RLS security is robust and adhering to the principle of least privilege.

### Objectives

- Introduce role-based access control (RBAC) within projects.
- Enable project administrators to manage user roles and permissions.
- Support the seamless integration of project membership management with existing authentication and authorization mechanisms.

## Functional Requirements

1. **Role Definition and Assignment:**
   - Support predefined roles (e.g., Admin, Editor, Viewer) with customizable permissions.
   - Allow project administrators to assign and revoke roles to users within their projects.

2. **Permission Management:**
   - Implement permissions that cover all user actions within the platform, including creating workflows, viewing logs, and managing project settings.
   - Permissions should be granular to allow for precise access control.

3. **User Interface for Membership Management:**
   - Develop UI components that enable project administrators to manage project members' roles easily.
   - Integrate these components with the existing project settings UI.

4. **Audit Logging:**
   - Record all membership changes (role assignments/revocations) in the audit log.

5. **API Support:**
   - Provide RESTful API endpoints to programmatically manage project membership.

## Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** Ensure that the project membership management operations do not significantly impact the overall performance of the platform.
- **Security:** Leverage existing RLS and encryption mechanisms to secure membership data. Ensure all changes go through authentication and authorization checks.
- **Maintainability:** Follow clean code practices, ensuring new code is modular, well-commented, and easy to understand.

## Technical Specifications

### Architecture Context

- **Supabase Authentication & Authorization:** Utilize Supabase's built-in capabilities for user management and integrate custom RBAC for project-level access control.
- **SvelteKit:** Build the management UI as part of the existing SvelteKit application, ensuring a consistent user experience.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Design Data Model for Roles & Permissions:**
   - Extend the existing schema to include `roles`, `permissions`, and a `user_project_roles` junction table.
   - Update `schema.sql` with new tables and relationships.

2. **API Development:**
   - Implement API endpoints for managing roles and permissions (`/api/roles`, `/api/permissions`, `/api/project-members`).

3. **UI Development:**
   - Design and implement UI components for role and permission management within the project settings page.
   - Ensure the UI is intuitive and accessible to non-technical users.

4. **Integration Testing:**
   - Conduct thorough testing to ensure new features work seamlessly with existing authentication and authorization flows.

5. **Documentation & Training:**
   - Update the project documentation to include guides on managing project membership.
   - Prepare training materials for project administrators.

### Data Model Changes

- New Tables:
  - `roles`: Stores role definitions.
  - `permissions`: Stores permission definitions.
  - `user_project_roles`: Associates users with roles within projects.

### API Endpoints

- POST `/api/projects/{projectId}/members`: Add a member to a project with a specific role.
- GET `/api/projects/{projectId}/members`: List project members and their roles.
- PATCH `/api/projects/{projectId}/members/{userId}`: Update a member's role.
- DELETE `/api/projects/{projectId}/members/{userId}`: Remove a member from a project.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Project administrators can assign, change, and revoke roles to users within their projects.
- [ ] Users can perform only those actions permitted by their roles.
- [ ] Membership changes are logged in the audit log.
- [ ] API endpoints for project membership management are functional and secure.
- [ ] UI for managing project membership is intuitive and consistent with the rest of the platform.
- [ ] Documentation and training materials are updated and available.

## Dependencies

- Supabase for authentication and authorization.
- Existing database schema and API infrastructure.
- Frontend development environment setup with SvelteKit.

## Implementation Notes

### Development Guidelines

- Use TypeScript for type safety and better code documentation.
- Follow existing patterns for API design and error handling.
- Ensure new UI components are responsive and match the platform's look and feel.

### Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests:** Write unit tests for all new backend logic and utility functions.
- **Integration Tests:** Test API endpoints to ensure they correctly interact with the database and other services.
- **UI Tests:** Use Playwright or a similar tool to test the new UI components and workflows.

### Security Considerations

- Ensure all membership management operations require proper authentication and authorization.
- Sanitize inputs to prevent SQL injection and other common web vulnerabilities.
- Use existing RLS policies to secure access to membership data.

### Monitoring & Observability

- Monitor API performance and error rates related to project membership management.
- Extend existing logging mechanisms to include membership management operations.

## Related Documentation

- Updated `schema.sql` reflecting the new data model.
- API documentation for the new endpoints (`/docs/api`).
- User guide for project administrators on managing project membership (`/docs/user-guide`).
