# PRD: Materialized Views for Metrics

## Overview

The introduction of materialized views for metrics in MeshHook aims to enhance observability and performance monitoring by aggregating and storing key workflow metrics in a more efficient and accessible manner. This initiative is part of Phase 6: Observability, underlining our commitment to providing high-level insight into workflow executions while maintaining system performance and reliability. By leveraging materialized views, MeshHook will offer real-time, actionable insights into workflow performance, error rates, and execution patterns, thus enabling users to optimize their workflows and system administrators to maintain system health effectively.

## Functional Requirements

1. **Materialized Views Development:** Develop materialized views in the Postgres database to aggregate essential metrics like workflow execution times, success and failure rates, execution counts, and resource usage statistics.
2. **Refresh Strategy:** Implement an automatic and efficient refresh mechanism for the materialized views to keep the metrics up to date with minimal latency and without substantial performance impact.
3. **Metrics Identification and Selection:** Collaboratively work with stakeholders to identify and select the most valuable metrics to be included in the materialized views, ensuring they align with user needs and system performance goals.
4. **Optimization and Indexing:** Design the materialized views with optimized queries and proper indexing to facilitate fast and efficient data retrieval and aggregation, minimizing the performance impact on the live database.
5. **Documentation and Knowledge Sharing:** Provide comprehensive documentation on the design, implementation, selected metrics, and refresh strategy of the materialized views. This should include any assumptions or trade-offs made during the design process.

## Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** The materialized views should be optimized for quick reads, ensuring that the performance of transactional operations in the system is not adversely affected.
- **Reliability:** The system must accurately aggregate and refresh metrics data, providing dependable insights even in the face of errors or refresh interruptions.
- **Security:** Implement robust security measures to control access to the materialized views, ensuring that sensitive information is adequately protected in line with MeshHook's security protocols.

## Technical Specifications

### Architecture Context

MeshHook utilizes SvelteKit for its front-end operations and Supabase (Postgres) for backend data storage and processing. The implementation of materialized views will be within this existing Supabase Postgres infrastructure, leveraging its advanced features for real-time data updates and efficient data querying capabilities.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Analysis and Planning:**
   - Conduct a thorough review of current metrics collection, storage, and reporting mechanisms to identify gaps and improvement opportunities.
   - Collaborate with stakeholders to identify key metrics that offer the most value for observability and monitoring.

2. **Design:**
   - Design the schema for the materialized views, focusing on the selected metrics.
   - Develop an optimized refresh strategy that balances currency of data with system performance.

3. **Development:**
   - Write and test SQL scripts to create the materialized views and associated indexes.
   - Develop or integrate a refresh mechanism for the materialized views, ensuring it operates efficiently and reliably.

4. **Deployment and Monitoring:**
   - Deploy the materialized views in a controlled environment to monitor their impact on system performance and data accuracy.
   - Adjust and optimize based on observations and stakeholder feedback.

### Data Model Changes

**Materialized Views Schema:**

- `mv_workflow_metrics`:
  - Columns: `workflow_id`, `execution_count`, `average_duration`, `success_rate`, `failure_rate`, `resource_consumption`, `last_updated`.
  - Indexes: Primary Key on `workflow_id`, Index on `last_updated`.

### API Endpoints

Adjustments to existing API endpoints may be necessary to incorporate the new materialized views for metrics retrieval. These changes will be documented and communicated accordingly.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Materialized views for the identified key metrics are successfully implemented and integrated into the MeshHook system.
- The refresh mechanism for the materialized views is operational, ensuring data remains current with minimal performance impact.
- Performance improvements are observable in metrics retrieval operations compared to the pre-implementation state.
- Documentation on the materialized views' design, implementation, and operational guidelines is complete and available to relevant stakeholders.
- No significant performance degradation is observed in transactional operations as a result of introducing the materialized views.

## Dependencies

- Access to the MeshHook Supabase Postgres instance for executing schema modifications.
- Collaboration with the MeshHook development team for identifying key metrics and integrating the materialized views into existing systems.

## Implementation Notes

### Development Guidelines

- Ensure all SQL scripts and related changes are thoroughly commented and adhere to MeshHook's code style and best practices.
- Prioritize backward compatibility, ensuring existing functionality related to metrics collection and reporting is not disrupted.

### Testing Strategy

- Conduct comprehensive unit and integration testing to validate the functionality and performance of the materialized views.
- Implement load testing scenarios to evaluate the impact of the materialized views on the overall system performance, particularly focusing on transactional operation response times.

### Security Considerations

- Implement strict access controls for the new materialized views, ensuring only authorized personnel and systems can access the metrics data.
- Ensure that the implementation of materialized views adheres to MeshHook's data protection policies, particularly regarding the handling of PII and sensitive information.

### Monitoring and Observability

- Set up monitoring for the refresh operations of the materialized views to track their performance, frequency, and any arising issues.
- Utilize existing Supabase Realtime capabilities or integrate additional monitoring tools as necessary to observe the impact of the materialized views on system performance and reliability.
