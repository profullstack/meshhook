# PRD: Documentation Review - Issue #220

## Overview

The Documentation Review is a critical task in Phase 10: Polish & Launch of the MeshHook project. This task is pivotal to ensuring that the project's documentation is accurate, comprehensive, and user-friendly, aligning with MeshHook's objectives to provide a webhook-first, deterministic, Postgres-native workflow engine that combines the visual simplicity of n8n and the durability of Temporal, without restrictive licensing. The focus will be on reviewing and refining documentation to ensure clarity, completeness, and adherence to technical accuracy, reflecting the project's current state and capabilities.

### Objectives:

- Validate the accuracy and completeness of documentation.
- Ensure documentation aligns with project goals and technical specifications.
- Enhance user comprehension and ease of use.
- Prepare documentation for project launch.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

1. Review and update the Main PRD, ensuring it accurately reflects the project's goals, functional and non-functional requirements, and technical specifications.
2. Validate the correctness of the Architecture Documentation, including system components, data models, and sequence diagrams.
3. Ensure the Security Documentation fully describes the project's security posture, including RLS, secrets management, and webhook verification.
4. Evaluate the API Documentation for completeness, accuracy, and clarity. Ensure all endpoints are properly documented with request/response examples.
5. Enhance the Operations Guide to include recent changes or additions in deployment procedures, monitoring, and maintenance tasks.

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **Accuracy:** Documentation must accurately reflect the current state of the project and its capabilities.
- **Clarity:** Documentation should be clear and understandable to the target audience, including developers, ops teams, and end-users.
- **Comprehensiveness:** Ensure all aspects of the project are thoroughly documented, leaving no functionality undocumented.
- **Consistency:** Maintain consistency in documentation style, terminology, and format across all documents.

## Technical Specifications

### Architecture Context

The documentation review must consider the project’s architecture, specifically:
- SvelteKit for SSR/API handling.
- Supabase integration for database, real-time updates, and storage.
- Worker roles within the system, including Orchestrator and HTTP Executor.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Analysis:** Conduct a comprehensive review of all existing documentation against the current codebase and project functionalities.
2. **Gap Identification:** Identify any discrepancies, outdated information, or missing documentation areas.
3. **Update Plan:** Outline specific updates needed for each documentation section, including new additions.
4. **Execution:** Update the documentation according to the plan, ensuring adherence to technical accuracy and clarity.
5. **Review:** Conduct a peer review of the updated documentation for further improvements.
6. **Finalize:** Incorporate feedback, finalize the documentation updates, and merge changes into the main branch.

### Data Model and API Endpoints

- No new data model changes or API endpoints are required for this task. The focus is on reviewing and updating existing documentation.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All documentation accurately reflects the current project state and functionalities.
- [ ] API documentation is complete with up-to-date request/response examples.
- [ ] Security documentation clearly explains the project's security model and practices.
- [ ] Operations guide includes the latest deployment, monitoring, and maintenance procedures.
- [ ] Documentation is clear, concise, and free of technical jargon where possible.
- [ ] Changes are reviewed and approved by at least one other project member.

## Dependencies

- Access to the current codebase to verify technical details.
- Collaboration with project maintainers for insights into recent changes or upcoming features.

## Implementation Notes

### Development Guidelines

- Follow Markdown formatting standards for documentation updates.
- Use diagrams and code snippets where applicable to enhance understanding.
- Ensure all documentation is accessible from the project’s main GitHub page.

### Testing Strategy

- Manual review of documentation in various environments (GitHub, local Markdown viewers) to ensure formatting and links work correctly.
- Use tools like Grammarly to check for grammatical errors and readability improvements.

### Security Considerations

- Verify that no sensitive information (e.g., secrets, passwords) is included in the documentation.
- Ensure that security practices and recommendations are clearly documented and easy to follow.

### Monitoring & Observability

- Not directly applicable to documentation but ensure any related tools or metrics are accurately described in the Operations Guide.

## Related Documentation

- Main PRD, Architecture, Security Guidelines, and Operations Guide as mentioned in the overview section.
- Any external documentation that provides context or further explanation of tools and technologies used within MeshHook.

This PRD aims to ensure MeshHook's documentation is a robust, accurate, and invaluable resource for users and contributors, facilitating a smooth launch and adoption of the project.
