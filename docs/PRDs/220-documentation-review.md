# PRD: Documentation Review for MeshHook - Task #220

## 1. Overview

The Documentation Review initiative for MeshHook, under Task #220, focuses on a holistic update and refinement of the project's documentation. This is aligned with the Phase 10: Polish & Launch milestone, ensuring that the documentation accurately reflects the current state of MeshHook's features, architecture, and operational guidelines. The primary goal is to enhance the clarity, accuracy, and accessibility of the documentation for developers, users, and contributors, thus facilitating easier adoption, implementation, and contribution to the MeshHook project.

### Objectives
- Update and refine documentation to match MeshHook's current capabilities and architectural nuances.
- Highlight MeshHook's unique features and selling points, such as its webhook-first approach, visual DAG builder, and comprehensive security measures.
- Improve the developer and user experience through clear, concise, and navigable documentation.

## 2. Functional Requirements

1. **Comprehensive Audit and Review:** Perform a detailed audit of the existing documentation to identify gaps, inaccuracies, and outdated content compared to the current state of MeshHook.
2. **API Documentation Refinement:** Ensure that the API documentation is up-to-date, with detailed descriptions of all endpoints, parameters, expected responses, and usage examples.
3. **Architectural and Operational Documentation:** Update documentation to accurately reflect MeshHook’s current architecture, focusing on its deterministic, Postgres-native approach, and the integration with Supabase Realtime for live logs.
4. **Security Documentation Update:** Thoroughly review and update security documentation to accurately represent MeshHook’s current security features, including RLS and webhook signature verification.
5. **Feature Documentation Enrichment:** Document all new features and significant updates to existing features, emphasizing the visual DAG builder and multi-tenant RLS security model.

## 3. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Accuracy and Clarity:** Documentation must be accurate, reflecting the current state of MeshHook, and written in clear, understandable language.
- **Consistency:** Ensure a consistent style, tone, and terminology across all documentation, adhering to the established style guide.
- **Accessibility:** Documentation should be structured and organized for easy navigation, with a comprehensive table of contents and search functionality.

## 4. Technical Specifications

### Architecture Considerations
- Document MeshHook’s webhook-first design, emphasizing webhook triggers, signature verification, and their roles in workflow initiation.
- Detail the use of the SvelteKit/Svelte 5 visual DAG builder, including step-by-step guides and use cases.
- Explain MeshHook’s durable, replayable runs leveraging Postgres for event sourcing, ensuring deterministic execution of workflows.
- Highlight the integration of Supabase Realtime for live workflow logs, enhancing the observability and debugging capabilities for users.
- Clarify the implementation of multi-tenant RLS security, including setup, configuration, and usage guidelines.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Documentation Inventory & Audit:** List and review all existing documentation, including GitHub READMEs, Wiki pages, and external documentation sites.
2. **Gap Analysis:** Compare current documentation against the actual functionality, architecture, and security implementations to identify discrepancies.
3. **Content Update & Creation:** Update existing documentation and create new content to fill identified gaps, prioritizing critical areas like security, API details, and architectural overviews.
4. **Peer Review & Iteration:** Conduct peer reviews of updated and newly created documentation to ensure accuracy, clarity, and completeness.
5. **Publication:** Deploy the updated documentation on the appropriate platforms, ensuring it is accessible and easily discoverable by the target audience.

### Data Model & API Changes
- The task focuses on documentation and does not directly involve changes to the data model or API endpoints. However, it's crucial to ensure that any recent changes to these areas are accurately documented.

## 5. Acceptance Criteria

- All existing and new features are thoroughly documented, with clear, accurate, and easy-to-follow descriptions.
- API documentation is comprehensive, including details on endpoints, parameters, and examples.
- Architectural documentation accurately reflects MeshHook’s current design and operational procedures.
- Security documentation correctly describes all security features, configurations, and best practices.
- The documentation is reviewed for clarity and accuracy, with any identified issues corrected.
- Updated documentation is published and readily accessible to developers and users.

## 6. Dependencies

- Full access to the latest MeshHook codebase and feature documentation.
- Collaboration with the MeshHook development team to clarify any uncertainties regarding features or architectural decisions.

### Prerequisite Tasks
- Completion of any pending feature updates or architectural changes that could impact the documentation content.

## 7. Implementation Notes

### Development Guidelines
- Use Markdown for documentation to ensure consistency and ease of updates.
- Adhere to the established documentation style guide, including the use of diagrams and charts to explain complex concepts.
- Incorporate feedback from developers and users to continuously improve the documentation's clarity and usefulness.

### Testing Strategy
- Perform peer reviews to validate the accuracy and clarity of the documentation.
- Utilize automated tools to check for broken links, formatting issues, and adherence to documentation standards.

### Security Considerations
- Ensure the security documentation accurately reflects MeshHook’s security measures and configurations.
- Do not include sensitive information in the public documentation; use placeholders where necessary.

### Monitoring & Observability
- Document any changes or enhancements to MeshHook’s monitoring and observability features, ensuring users have the necessary information to effectively manage their workflows.
