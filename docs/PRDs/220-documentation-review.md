# PRD: Documentation Review for MeshHook - Task #220

## 1. Overview

The Documentation Review for MeshHook aims to refine and update project documentation in alignment with the latest developments and features as MeshHook approaches its Phase 10: Polish & Launch milestone. This task is critical for ensuring that both new and existing users, as well as developers, have access to accurate, clear, and comprehensive documentation that reflects the current state and capabilities of MeshHook. It supports the project's goals by enhancing usability, fostering developer engagement, and ensuring that the project's unique selling points are effectively communicated.

### Objectives
- Ensure all documentation is current, with a specific focus on accuracy and clarity to reflect MeshHook's latest features and architecture.
- Highlight MeshHook's unique features, including its webhook-first approach, visual simplicity, and robust security measures, to facilitate user adoption and engagement.
- Improve the overall developer and user experience by providing easily navigable and understandable documentation.

## 2. Functional Requirements

1. **Comprehensive Audit:** Conduct a thorough review of all existing documentation against the current state of MeshHook to identify inaccuracies or areas for enhancement.
2. **API Documentation Overhaul:** Update the API documentation to accurately describe all endpoints, including parameters, response objects, and examples.
3. **Architectural Documentation Update:** Refresh the architectural and operational documentation to reflect the current system architecture and deployment procedures accurately.
4. **Security Documentation Enhancement:** Verify and update the security documentation to accurately depict MeshHook’s security features and mechanisms.
5. **Feature Documentation Inclusion:** Document any new features or significant updates to existing features that have occurred since the last documentation review.

## 3. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Accuracy:** All documentation must correctly represent the current functionalities and architecture of MeshHook.
- **Clarity:** The documentation should be easily understood by both technical and non-technical users.
- **Consistency:** Maintain a consistent style and terminology across all documentation to ensure a seamless user experience.
- **Accessibility:** Organize documentation to be easily navigable, with a structured flow and search functionality to quickly find needed information.

## 4. Technical Specifications

### Architecture Considerations
- Highlight MeshHook’s webhook-first approach, detailing how this influences workflow triggers and execution.
- Provide clear examples of how to use the SvelteKit/Svelte 5 DAG builder within MeshHook.
- Explain the role of Postgres in ensuring determinism and durability through event sourcing.
- Detail the integration with Supabase Realtime for live logs and how it enhances user experience.
- Describe the multi-tenant security model, emphasizing Row-Level Security (RLS) and its configuration.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Documentation Inventory:** List all current documentation resources, including inline documentation, README files, and external documentation portals.
2. **Gap Analysis:** Identify discrepancies between the documented features/architecture and the current state of MeshHook.
3. **Update Prioritization:** Prioritize documentation updates starting with critical areas such as security and API documentation.
4. **Revision and Expansion:** Revise existing documentation and create new content where necessary, ensuring adherence to non-functional requirements.
5. **Review Process:** Conduct peer reviews of the updated and new documentation to ensure accuracy and clarity.
6. **Deployment:** Publish the updated documentation in a manner that is easily accessible to users.

### Data Model & API Endpoints
- No changes to the data model or API endpoints are required for this task. However, the documentation should accurately reflect any recent changes to these areas.

## 5. Acceptance Criteria

- Documentation accurately reflects MeshHook’s current features, architecture, and operational guidelines.
- API documentation includes comprehensive information on endpoints, parameters, and examples.
- Architectural and operational documentation provides clear insights into the system’s design and deployment.
- Security documentation correctly represents MeshHook’s security features and configurations.
- All revised and new documentation has been reviewed for accuracy and clarity.
- Updated documentation is published and easily accessible to the intended audience.

## 6. Dependencies

- Access to the latest version of the MeshHook codebase and knowledge of upcoming features.
- Familiarity with the current tools and platforms used for MeshHook documentation.

### Prerequisite Tasks
- Finalization of any pending feature development or architectural changes that would impact the documentation content.

## 7. Implementation Notes

### Development Guidelines
- Utilize Markdown for all documentation to support ease of updates and compatibility with various platforms.
- Follow the established style guide to ensure consistency across all documentation.
- Include diagrams or charts as necessary to help explain complex concepts or architecture.

### Testing Strategy
- Conduct peer reviews to validate the clarity and accuracy of the documentation.
- Use automated tools where possible to check for broken links, formatting issues, and other common documentation errors.

### Security Considerations
- Ensure that the security documentation accurately reflects MeshHook's security posture, including new or modified features.
- Avoid including sensitive information in public documentation, using placeholders where appropriate.

### Monitoring & Observability
- Accurately document any changes to MeshHook’s monitoring or observability features to ensure users can effectively track and manage their workflows.
