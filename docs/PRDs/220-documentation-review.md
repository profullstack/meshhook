## Technical Specifications

### Architecture Context
<<<<<<< HEAD
The documentation review should consider MeshHook's architecture, emphasizing its webhook-first approach, use of SvelteKit/Svelte 5 for the visual DAG builder, and its reliance on Postgres for durable, event-sourced workflow execution. Integration points with Supabase Realtime for live logs and the implementation of multi-tenant RLS security features should also be highlighted.

### Implementation Approach
1. **Audit and Inventory:** Catalogue all existing documentation resources, including inline code comments, READMEs, and external docs.
2. **Gap Analysis:** Identify discrepancies between current project capabilities and documented features.
3. **Prioritization:** Prioritize documentation updates based on criticality, with security and API documentation at the top.
4. **Revision and Creation:** Update existing documents and create new content as needed, ensuring adherence to the non-functional requirements.
5. **Peer Review:** Conduct internal reviews of the updated documentation to ensure accuracy and clarity.
6. **Publication:** Publish the updated documentation, replacing or supplementing existing materials as appropriate.

### Data Model & API Endpoints
- No new data model changes or API endpoints are introduced for this task. Existing documentation should be updated to reflect the current schema and API surface accurately.
