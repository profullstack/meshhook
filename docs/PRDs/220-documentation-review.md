# PRD: Documentation Review - Task #220

## Overview

The purpose of this task is to perform a comprehensive review and update of MeshHook's documentation, aligning it with the project's latest developments and ensuring clarity, completeness, and accessibility. This is a critical step in the project's Phase 10: Polish & Launch, ensuring that all stakeholders, including developers, end-users, and internal team members, have accurate and detailed information to effectively engage with the MeshHook platform. This task directly supports MeshHook's goals by ensuring that the features such as webhook triggers, visual DAG builder, durable runs, and multi-tenant security are well-documented and understood, facilitating ease of use and adoption.

### Objectives
- Ensure all documentation accurately reflects the current capabilities and architecture of MeshHook.
- Provide clear, comprehensive, and accessible documentation to facilitate user onboarding and developer engagement.
- Highlight MeshHook's unique features and advantages, including its webhook-first approach, Postgres-native determinism, and visual simplicity.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
1. Conduct a thorough audit of existing documentation, identifying gaps, inaccuracies, or outdated information.
2. Update the API documentation to include all current endpoints, parameters, response objects, and examples.
3. Revise the architectural overview and operational guidelines to reflect MeshHook's latest design and best practices.
4. Ensure the security documentation accurately describes current security mechanisms, including RLS and webhook signature verification.
5. Incorporate documentation for new features or enhancements introduced since the last documentation review.

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **Accuracy:** Documentation must accurately reflect the current state of the MeshHook project.
- **Clarity:** Information should be presented in a clear, understandable manner suitable for the target audience.
- **Consistency:** Maintain consistency in terminology, formatting, and style across all documentation materials.
- **Accessibility:** Structure documentation to be easily navigable, with a logical flow and search capabilities.

## Technical Specifications

### Architecture Context
The documentation review should consider MeshHook's architecture, emphasizing its webhook-first approach, use of SvelteKit/Svelte 5 for the visual DAG builder, and its reliance on Postgres for durable, event-sourced workflow execution. Integration points with Supabase Realtime for live logs and the implementation of multi-tenant RLS security features should also be highlighted.

### Implementation Approach
1. **Audit and Inventory:** Catalogue all existing documentation resources, including inline code comments, READMEs, and external docs.
2. **Gap Analysis:** Identify discrepancies between current project capabilities and documented features.
3. **Prioritization:** Prioritize documentation updates based on criticality, with security and API documentation at the top.
4. **Revision and Creation:** Update existing documents and create new content as needed, ensuring adherence to the non-functional requirements.
5. **Peer Review:** Conduct internal reviews of the updated documentation to ensure accuracy and clarity.
6. **Publication:** Publish the updated documentation, replacing or supplementing existing materials as appropriate.

### Data Model & API Endpoints
- No new data model changes or API endpoints are introduced for this task. Existing documentation should be updated to reflect the current schema and API surface accurately.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All documentation accurately reflects the current state and capabilities of MeshHook.
- [ ] API documentation is comprehensive, with clear, tested examples.
- [ ] Architectural and operational documentation provides a clear understanding of MeshHook's design and deployment.
- [ ] Security documentation accurately describes mechanisms and best practices for securing MeshHook instances.
- [ ] The documentation review has been validated by at least one peer review.
- [ ] Updated documentation is published and accessible to the intended audience.

## Dependencies

### Technical Dependencies
- Access to the current MeshHook codebase and any pending changes slated for the upcoming release.
- Documentation tools and platforms currently in use by the project (e.g., Git, Markdown editors).

### Prerequisite Tasks
- Finalization of features and architectural changes impacting the documentation for the upcoming release.

## Implementation Notes

### Development Guidelines
- Use Markdown for all documentation to ensure compatibility and ease of updates.
- Adhere to the existing style guide to maintain consistency across documents.
- Where applicable, include diagrams or charts to illustrate complex concepts or architectures.

### Testing Strategy
- Employ peer reviews to test the clarity and accuracy of the updated documentation.
- Utilize documentation tooling to check for broken links, formatting issues, and accessibility concerns.

### Security Considerations
- Ensure that updated security documentation accurately reflects MeshHook's current security posture, including any new features or changes.
- Avoid including sensitive information in public documentation; use placeholders where necessary.

### Monitoring & Observability
- Not directly applicable for this documentation task. However, ensure any changes to MeshHook's monitoring and observability features are accurately documented.

## Related Documentation
- Existing project documentation (README.md, docs/Architecture.md, docs/Security.md, etc.)
- Project codebase for inline documentation review and updates

## Task Details

**Original Task Description:** Documentation review as part of the project's Phase 10: Polish & Launch. The focus is on ensuring all project documentation is current, clear, and correctly aligned with MeshHook's capabilities and architecture.

**Completion Criteria:** This task is considered complete when all acceptance criteria are met, and the updated documentation is published and accessible to the project's stakeholders.
