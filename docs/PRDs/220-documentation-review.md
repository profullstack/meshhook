# PRD: Documentation Review for MeshHook - Task #220

## 1. Overview

The Documentation Review task is pivotal for MeshHook's Phase 10: Polish & Launch milestone. This task focuses on ensuring that all project documentation accurately reflects the current features, architecture, and operational guidelines of MeshHook. Given MeshHook’s unique selling propositions—such as its webhook-first approach, visual simplicity via a SvelteKit/Svelte 5 DAG builder, and robust durability and security features—it is imperative that the documentation comprehensively and clearly communicates these aspects to foster user adoption and developer engagement.

### Objectives
- To provide up-to-date, clear, and comprehensive documentation that mirrors the current state of MeshHook.
- To elucidate MeshHook's unique features and technical advantages to facilitate ease of adoption and maximize user engagement.
- To enhance developer and user experience through accessible, navigable, and understandable documentation.

## 2. Functional Requirements

1. **Audit and Gap Identification:** Perform a meticulous audit of existing documentation against the current MeshHook feature set, architecture, and operational procedures to identify any discrepancies, outdated information, or gaps.
2. **API Documentation Update:** Revise and expand the API documentation to encapsulate all existing endpoints, their requisite parameters, possible response objects, and illustrative examples.
3. **Architectural and Operational Documentation Revision:** Update the architectural overview and operational guidelines to accurately represent the latest system design, deployment practices, and best use cases.
4. **Security Documentation Accuracy:** Ensure the security documentation is up-to-date, detailing the current security features like Row-Level Security (RLS) and webhook signature verification mechanisms.
5. **Feature Documentation:** Integrate documentation for any new features or updates that have been added since the last documentation iteration.

## 3. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Accuracy:** Documentation must be a true reflection of the current MeshHook system in its entirety.
- **Clarity:** Documentation should be written in a clear, concise manner, making it accessible to both technical and non-technical audiences.
- **Consistency:** Ensure uniformity in style, terminology, and presentation across the entire documentation suite.
- **Accessibility:** Organize the documentation to facilitate easy navigation with a structured flow and search functionality.

## 4. Technical Specifications

### Architecture Context
The documentation must take into account MeshHook’s foundational architecture, particularly highlighting:
- The webhook-first approach for triggering workflows.
- The use of SvelteKit/Svelte 5 for the visual DAG builder.
- Postgres-native determinism and durability, supported by event sourcing.
- Integration with Supabase Realtime for live logging.
- Multi-tenant security features including Row-Level Security (RLS).

### Implementation Approach

1. **Audit and Inventory:** Compile an exhaustive list of all existing documentation, including inline code comments, README files, and external documentation resources.
2. **Gap Analysis:** Cross-reference the current MeshHook functionality and features with the existing documentation to pinpoint inaccuracies or missing information.
3. **Prioritization:** Rank the documentation updates based on their criticality, starting with security and API documentation.
4. **Revision and Creation:** Update and/or create documentation content as identified in the prioritization phase, adhering to the specified non-functional requirements.
5. **Peer Review:** Submit the revised and newly created documentation for internal review to validate accuracy and clarity.
6. **Publication:** Release the updated documentation, ensuring it is readily accessible to the target audience.

### Data Model & API Endpoints
- The task does not introduce changes to the data model or API endpoints. However, existing documentation should be meticulously updated to accurately reflect the current API structure and data model.

## 5. Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Documentation accurately mirrors the current functionality, architecture, and operational guidelines of MeshHook.
- [ ] API documentation is thorough, featuring clear examples that have been validated.
- [ ] Architectural and operational documentation offers clear insight into MeshHook’s design principles and deployment strategies.
- [ ] Security documentation correctly outlines the existing security features and practices.
- [ ] Documentation updates have undergone and passed peer review.
- [ ] The revised documentation is published and accessible.

## 6. Dependencies

- Access to the latest MeshHook codebase and any in-development features for the forthcoming release.
- Availability of current documentation tools and platforms utilized by MeshHook.

### Prerequisite Tasks
- Completion of any feature development and architectural modifications affecting documentation content for the upcoming release.

## 7. Implementation Notes

### Development Guidelines
- Utilize Markdown for all documentation to ensure ease of updates and compatibility across viewing platforms.
- Adhere to the established style guide to maintain consistency.
- Incorporate diagrams or charts where necessary to elucidate complex concepts.

### Testing Strategy
- Implement peer reviews to assess the clarity and accuracy of the updated documentation.
- Use documentation tools to check for and resolve broken links, formatting errors, and accessibility issues.

### Security Considerations
- Ensure the security documentation accurately represents MeshHook’s security posture, including any recent changes.
- Exclude sensitive information from public documentation, using placeholders as needed.

### Monitoring & Observability
- While not directly applicable to this documentation task, any modifications to MeshHook’s monitoring or observability features must be accurately documented.

## Related Documentation
- Current project documentation including README.md, docs/Architecture.md, docs/Security.md, etc.
- MeshHook codebase for inline documentation review and updates.
