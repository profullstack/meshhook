# PRD: Documentation Review for MeshHook

## Overview

The purpose of this task is to conduct a thorough review and update of the MeshHook documentation in preparation for the project's launch. This encompasses all existing documentation, including the API documentation, architectural overviews, security guidelines, and operation manuals. The goal is to ensure that all documentation is clear, accurate, comprehensive, and aligns with the final state of the MeshHook project. This task is critical for providing end-users, developers, and internal stakeholders with the information necessary to effectively use, contribute to, and understand the MeshHook project.

### Objectives
- Ensure documentation accuracy and completeness.
- Align documentation with the project's current state and best practices.
- Enhance user and developer understanding of MeshHook.
- Facilitate easier onboarding and implementation for new users.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
1. **Comprehensive Review:** Audit all existing documentation for accuracy, relevance, and completeness.
2. **Update Documentation:** Revise and update documentation to reflect the current state of the MeshHook project, including any new features, changes, or removals.
3. **API Documentation:** Ensure that all public APIs are thoroughly documented, including request parameters, response objects, error codes, and usage examples.
4. **Security Documentation:** Review and update the security guidelines to reflect any new security features or changes in the project's security posture.
5. **Architectural Overview:** Update the architectural documentation to accurately represent the current architecture, including any new components or patterns.
6. **Operational Guidelines:** Ensure that operational documentation, including deployment, monitoring, and maintenance instructions, is accurate and detailed.

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **Accuracy:** Ensure that all documentation is factually correct and reflects the latest project state.
- **Clarity:** Documentation should be clearly written and easy to understand for its target audience.
- **Consistency:** Maintain a consistent tone, style, and formatting across all documentation.
- **Accessibility:** Documentation should be organized and searchable to facilitate easy access to information.

## Technical Specifications

### Architecture Context
- Review the documentation in the context of MeshHook's architecture, ensuring that all components (SvelteKit, Supabase, Workers) and their interactions are accurately described.

### Implementation Approach
1. **Audit Existing Documentation:** Identify all existing documentation assets within the project.
2. **Identify Gaps and Inaccuracies:** List areas where documentation is missing, outdated, or inaccurate.
3. **Prioritize Updates:** Based on the project roadmap and user feedback, prioritize documentation updates.
4. **Revise and Update:** Make the necessary changes to the documentation, focusing on clarity, accuracy, and completeness.
5. **Peer Review:** Have the documentation reviewed by another team member for accuracy and clarity.
6. **Publish Updates:** Update the project repository and any other locations where the documentation is hosted.
