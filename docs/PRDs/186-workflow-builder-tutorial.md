# PRD: Workflow Builder Tutorial

## Overview

This Product Requirements Document (PRD) outlines the development of a Workflow Builder Tutorial for MeshHook, a webhook-first, deterministic, Postgres-native workflow engine. This tutorial aims to provide users with comprehensive guidance on leveraging the visual DAG builder for creating, managing, and optimizing workflows within MeshHook. By integrating educational materials directly into the user experience, we strive to enhance user adoption, reduce the learning curve, and empower users to fully utilize MeshHook's capabilities.

Aligning with MeshHook's objectives, this tutorial will emphasize the engine's core features, including webhook triggers with signature verification, the use of SvelteKit/Svelte 5 for a seamless visual DAG building experience, event sourcing for durable, replayable runs, live logs via Supabase Realtime, and multi-tenant RLS security.

## Functional Requirements

1. **Interactive Tutorial Creation:** Develop an interactive, step-by-step guide within the MeshHook platform that demonstrates how to create a workflow using the visual DAG builder.
2. **Sample Workflows:** Include a variety of sample workflows that cover common use cases, demonstrating the application of different nodes and functionalities such as `transform`, `http_call`, `branch`, `delay`, and `terminate`.
3. **Progress Tracking:** Implement progress tracking within the tutorial, allowing users to resume where they left off.
4. **Feedback Mechanism:** Incorporate a feedback mechanism at the end of the tutorial for users to rate their experience and provide suggestions for improvement.
5. **Accessibility and Usability:** Ensure the tutorial is accessible to all users, including compliance with WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) and responsive design for various devices.
6. **Localization:** Prepare the tutorial content for future localization efforts, structuring it to easily accommodate translations into different languages.

## Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** The tutorial should load swiftly and interactively without causing significant delays in the user experience.
- **Reliability:** The tutorial must be reliable and available, with built-in fault tolerance to handle user errors gracefully.
- **Security:** Adhere to the project's security guidelines, ensuring any user input within the tutorial is validated and sanitized.
- **Maintainability:** Write clean, modular, and well-documented code to ensure the tutorial is easy to update and maintain.

## Technical Specifications

### Architecture Context

The tutorial will integrate seamlessly with the existing MeshHook components, utilizing the SvelteKit framework for the frontend to maintain consistency with the visual DAG builder's technology stack.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Planning:** Define the scope and objectives of the tutorial, including key concepts and functionalities to cover.
2. **Content Creation:** Draft the tutorial content, ensuring it is clear, concise, and informative. Collaborate with UX/UI designers to create engaging and interactive components.
3. **Development:** Implement the tutorial following the design specifications, utilizing SvelteKit for frontend components.
4. **Integration:** Integrate the tutorial within the MeshHook platform, ensuring it is easily accessible from the dashboard.
5. **Testing:** Conduct thorough testing, including user acceptance testing (UAT) to gather feedback and iterate on the tutorial design and content.
6. **Deployment:** Deploy the tutorial in a production environment, monitor its usage, and collect user feedback for continuous improvement.

### Data Model

No new data model changes are required specifically for this task. However, to support progress tracking within the tutorial, consider extending the user profile schema to include fields related to tutorial progress and completion status.

### API Endpoints

No new API endpoints are required specifically for this task. The tutorial content and progress tracking can be managed client-side or through existing user management APIs.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Interactive tutorial is fully integrated within the MeshHook platform.
- [ ] Tutorial covers key features and functionalities of the visual DAG builder.
- [ ] Users can start, pause, and resume the tutorial at any time.
- [ ] Feedback mechanism is implemented and operational.
- [ ] Tutorial complies with performance, security, and accessibility standards.
- [ ] User testing is completed, and feedback is incorporated into the final implementation.

## Dependencies

- Access to the existing MeshHook codebase and development environment.
- Collaboration with the UX/UI design team for interface design.
- Coordination with the security team to ensure compliance with security standards.

## Implementation Notes

### Development Guidelines

- Follow the existing coding standards and best practices for MeshHook.
- Utilize the SvelteKit framework for frontend development.
- Ensure code is modular, well-commented, and easily maintainable.

### Testing Strategy

- Perform unit and integration tests for new components.
- Conduct user acceptance testing (UAT) to validate the tutorial's effectiveness and user experience.

### Security Considerations

- Validate and sanitize any user input received through the tutorial's feedback mechanism.
- Ensure that tutorial progress tracking does not expose sensitive user information.

### Monitoring and Observability

- Implement logging for tutorial progress and feedback submissions.
- Monitor user engagement with the tutorial and collect metrics on completion rates and feedback scores.

By adhering to these guidelines, the Workflow Builder Tutorial will serve as a valuable resource for MeshHook users, facilitating a deeper understanding of the platform's capabilities and promoting effective workflow creation.
