# PRD: Workflow Builder Tutorial for MeshHook

## 1. Overview

The development of a Workflow Builder Tutorial is tasked with providing an engaging, interactive learning experience for users of MeshHook, enhancing their understanding and proficiency with the visual DAG builder. This tutorial will serve as an essential tool in onboarding new users, reducing the learning curve, and enabling users to leverage the full power of MeshHook for creating efficient and robust workflows.

This tutorial aligns with MeshHook's goal to offer a user-friendly, yet powerful workflow engine that combines the simplicity of visual programming with the reliability and scalability of a webhook-first, deterministic, Postgres-native architecture.

## 2. Functional Requirements

1. **Interactive Tutorial Framework:** Implement an interactive tutorial system within the MeshHook user interface that guides users through creating and managing workflows step by step.
   
2. **Comprehensive Content Coverage:** Cover essential topics, including webhook configuration, node utilization (`transform`, `http_call`, etc.), error handling, and security best practices.
   
3. **Use Case Demonstrations:** Provide real-world use case scenarios within the tutorial, showing how to solve common problems with MeshHook.
   
4. **Progress Tracking and Management:** Enable users to save their progress through the tutorial, allowing them to pause and resume at their convenience.
   
5. **Feedback Collection:** Integrate a feedback collection mechanism upon tutorial completion to gather user insights and suggestions for future improvements.

## 3. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** Ensure the tutorial system is optimized for quick loading and smooth interaction, minimizing any disruption to the user experience.
  
- **Reliability:** Design the tutorial to be fault-tolerant, ensuring it is always accessible and functions correctly across all supported platforms and devices.
  
- **Security:** Follow MeshHook's security guidelines, particularly in handling user input and data within the tutorial.
  
- **Maintainability:** Code should be modular, well-documented, and adhere to the project's coding standards, facilitating easy updates and maintenance.

## 4. Technical Specifications

### Architecture Context

The tutorial will be integrated into the existing MeshHook platform, leveraging the SvelteKit/Svelte 5 stack for frontend consistency. It will interact with MeshHook's core components, enhancing the user interface without modifying the underlying workflow engine or data models significantly.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Design Phase:** Collaborate with UI/UX designers to outline the tutorial's user interface and user experience flow. Prioritize simplicity and intuitive design.
   
2. **Content Development:** Work with technical writers and experienced MeshHook users to develop clear, concise, and helpful tutorial content.
   
3. **Tutorial Implementation:** Build the tutorial using SvelteKit, integrating it into the MeshHook dashboard. Ensure the tutorial is dynamic and interactive, supporting various learning paths.
   
4. **Progress Tracking Integration:** Extend the user profile schema to include tutorial progress, allowing users to pause and resume the tutorial seamlessly.
   
5. **Feedback Mechanism:** Implement a simple, intuitive mechanism for collecting user feedback at the tutorial's conclusion.

### Data Model Changes

- Extend the `User` entity to include:
  - `tutorialProgress`: JSON field to store progress information, including completed sections and timestamps.
  - `tutorialFeedbackSubmitted`: Boolean to track if feedback has been submitted.

### API Endpoints

N/A - Tutorial progress and feedback will be managed using existing user profile management functionality.

## 5. Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Users can access the tutorial directly from the MeshHook dashboard.
- [ ] The tutorial provides a comprehensive guide on creating and managing workflows with the visual DAG builder.
- [ ] Progress tracking allows users to pause and resume the tutorial at their convenience.
- [ ] The feedback collection mechanism is functional and user-friendly.
- [ ] The tutorial adheres to MeshHook's performance, security, and accessibility standards.
- [ ] User feedback is collected and analyzed for future tutorial improvements.

## 6. Dependencies and Prerequisites

- Access to MeshHook's current development environment and codebase.
- Collaboration with UI/UX design teams for the tutorial's interface design.
- Technical writing resources for content creation.

## 7. Implementation Notes

### Development Guidelines

- Follow MeshHook's established coding, security, and architectural patterns.
- Use SvelteKit for frontend development, ensuring consistency and reusability of components.
  
### Testing Strategy

- Perform unit tests for all new components and integration tests for the tutorial system within the MeshHook environment.
- Conduct user acceptance testing (UAT) with a small group of end-users to validate the tutorial's effectiveness and user experience.

### Security Considerations

- Ensure all user inputs within the tutorial are validated and sanitized to prevent XSS and other input-related vulnerabilities.
- Tutorial progress and feedback must be securely stored and transmitted, adhering to MeshHook's existing security protocols.

### Monitoring and Observability

- Implement logging for tutorial interactions, progress, and feedback submissions to monitor engagement and identify potential issues.
- Use analytics tools to track tutorial completion rates and collect aggregated feedback scores for continuous improvement.

By fulfilling these requirements and guidelines, the Workflow Builder Tutorial will significantly contribute to MeshHook's user experience, fostering a more robust understanding and efficient use of the platform.
