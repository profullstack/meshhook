# PRD: Automated Testing for MeshHook

## Overview

<<<<<<< HEAD
Automated testing is crucial for maintaining the high quality and reliability of the MeshHook project, a webhook-first, deterministic, Postgres-native workflow engine. This task aims to ensure that all features, especially new additions, adhere to the project's stringent requirements for security, performance, and functionality without introducing regressions or performance bottlenecks.

### Purpose

The purpose of this task is to implement a comprehensive automated testing suite that covers unit, integration, and end-to-end (E2E) tests. This suite will facilitate continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) processes, enabling faster and more reliable deployment cycles while ensuring the project's core functionalities, such as webhook triggers, visual DAG builder, durable runs, live logs, and multi-tenant RLS security, are consistently validated against regressions and bugs.

### Alignment with Project Goals

This task directly supports MeshHook's goals by:
- Ensuring the reliability and security of webhook triggers and signature verification.
- Validating the visual DAG builder's functionality and user interactions.
- Guaranteeing the durability and correctness of replayable runs.
- Confirming real-time capabilities of live logs via Supabase Realtime.
- Upholding multi-tenant RLS security standards.
=======
Automated testing is vital for ensuring the reliability, security, and performance of MeshHook. This task aligns with the project's goals to deliver a deterministic, Postgres-native workflow engine with features like webhook triggers, visual DAG builder, durable runs, live logs, and multi-tenant security. By implementing comprehensive automated testing, we aim to maintain high-quality standards, facilitate easier code maintenance, and enable faster iteration cycles.

### Objectives

- Ensure that new features and bug fixes do not introduce regressions.
- Validate the integration and performance of the system under various scenarios.
- Streamline the development and deployment process with CI/CD pipelines.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

<<<<<<< HEAD
1. **Comprehensive Test Coverage:** Develop tests to cover >80% of the codebase, focusing on critical paths such as webhook processing, DAG execution, and user authentication.
2. **Automated Test Execution:** Integrate the testing suite with GitHub Actions to automatically run tests against every commit and pull request.
3. **Regression Testing:** Include tests to cover previously fixed bugs and critical issues to prevent regressions.
4. **Testing Documentation:** Create documentation for the testing suite, including how to write, run, and update tests.

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** Tests should be optimized to run quickly, aiming to not significantly impact CI/CD pipeline execution times.
- **Reliability:** Tests must be deterministic, reducing flakiness and ensuring consistent results across runs.
- **Security:** Testing should include validation of security features, including RLS and webhook signature verification.
- **Maintainability:** The testing framework and tests should be easy to update and extend as the project evolves.
=======
1. **Test Coverage:** Achieve >80% code coverage across unit, integration, and e2e tests.
2. **Automated Test Suite:** Develop a suite that includes:
   - Unit tests for isolated functions and components.
   - Integration tests to verify component interactions and data flow.
   - End-to-end (e2e) tests to simulate real-world usage scenarios.
3. **CI Integration:** Integrate the test suite with GitHub Actions to run tests on every push and pull request.
4. **Regression Testing:** Ensure the suite covers regression scenarios for critical features.
5. **Documentation:** Provide detailed documentation on how to write, run, and maintain tests.

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** Ensure tests can run within a reasonable time frame to not delay CI pipelines.
- **Reliability:** Tests should be deterministic, avoiding flaky results.
- **Security:** Include security-focused tests, especially for critical paths like authentication, data validation, and RLS.
- **Maintainability:** Ensure the testing framework and tests are easy to extend as the project grows.

## Technical Specifications

### Architecture Context

<<<<<<< HEAD
MeshHook is built on a stack that includes SvelteKit/Svelte 5 for the frontend, Supabase for backend services, and a combination of custom workers for background processing. The automated testing suite needs to integrate seamlessly across these components, validating their interaction and ensuring the reliability and security of the system as a whole.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Tool Selection:** Choose appropriate tools for unit testing (e.g., Jest), integration testing (e.g., Supertest), and E2E testing (e.g., Cypress or Playwright).
2. **Test Development:** Adopt a Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach to implement tests across all levels:
   - Unit tests for individual functions and components.
   - Integration tests to verify the interactions between different parts of the system.
   - E2E tests to simulate real-user scenarios and interactions with the system.
3. **CI/CD Integration:** Configure GitHub Actions to automatically execute the test suite on all pushes and pull requests, ensuring no breaking changes are merged.
4. **Documentation:** Update the project's documentation to include a new section on the automated testing strategy, guidelines for writing tests, and instructions for running and maintaining the test suite.

### Data Model Changes

No changes to the data model are anticipated specifically for the implementation of automated testing. Should any changes be required, they will be documented and reviewed as part of the development process.
=======
MeshHook uses a combination of SvelteKit for the frontend, Supabase for backend services, and a set of workers for orchestration and execution. Automated testing must integrate seamlessly with these components and the existing GitHub Actions CI/CD setup.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Analysis:** Evaluate the existing test coverage and identify high-risk areas lacking tests.
2. **Framework Selection:** Choose testing frameworks compatible with our stack (e.g., Jest for unit/integration tests, Cypress or Playwright for e2e tests).
3. **Test Development:** Follow a TDD approach to develop tests covering all critical paths and functionalities.
4. **CI/CD Integration:** Configure GitHub Actions to run the test suite on every push and pull request, ensuring tests pass before merging.
5. **Documentation:** Update the developer documentation to include guidelines on writing and running tests.
