# PRD: Automated Testing for MeshHook

## Overview

Automated testing is vital for ensuring the reliability, security, and performance of MeshHook. This task aligns with the project's goals to deliver a deterministic, Postgres-native workflow engine with features like webhook triggers, visual DAG builder, durable runs, live logs, and multi-tenant security. By implementing comprehensive automated testing, we aim to maintain high-quality standards, facilitate easier code maintenance, and enable faster iteration cycles.

### Objectives

- Ensure that new features and bug fixes do not introduce regressions.
- Validate the integration and performance of the system under various scenarios.
- Streamline the development and deployment process with CI/CD pipelines.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

1. **Test Coverage:** Achieve >80% code coverage across unit, integration, and e2e tests.
2. **Automated Test Suite:** Develop a suite that includes:
   - Unit tests for isolated functions and components.
   - Integration tests to verify component interactions and data flow.
   - End-to-end (e2e) tests to simulate real-world usage scenarios.
3. **CI Integration:** Integrate the test suite with GitHub Actions to run tests on every push and pull request.
4. **Regression Testing:** Ensure the suite covers regression scenarios for critical features.
5. **Documentation:** Provide detailed documentation on how to write, run, and maintain tests.

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** Ensure tests can run within a reasonable time frame to not delay CI pipelines.
- **Reliability:** Tests should be deterministic, avoiding flaky results.
- **Security:** Include security-focused tests, especially for critical paths like authentication, data validation, and RLS.
- **Maintainability:** Ensure the testing framework and tests are easy to extend as the project grows.

## Technical Specifications

### Architecture Context

MeshHook uses a combination of SvelteKit for the frontend, Supabase for backend services, and a set of workers for orchestration and execution. Automated testing must integrate seamlessly with these components and the existing GitHub Actions CI/CD setup.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Analysis:** Evaluate the existing test coverage and identify high-risk areas lacking tests.
2. **Framework Selection:** Choose testing frameworks compatible with our stack (e.g., Jest for unit/integration tests, Cypress or Playwright for e2e tests).
3. **Test Development:** Follow a TDD approach to develop tests covering all critical paths and functionalities.
4. **CI/CD Integration:** Configure GitHub Actions to run the test suite on every push and pull request, ensuring tests pass before merging.
5. **Documentation:** Update the developer documentation to include guidelines on writing and running tests.

### Data Model

Not applicable for this task unless tests lead to a discovery requiring data model adjustments.

### API Endpoints

Not directly applicable, but testing may cover existing endpoints to ensure they meet functional and performance expectations.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Test suite achieves >80% code coverage.
- [ ] All tests pass consistently without flakiness.
- [ ] GitHub Actions configured to run tests on every push and PR.
- [ ] Documentation updated with testing guidelines.
- [ ] Performance benchmarks for test suite execution are established and met.

## Dependencies

- Access to the MeshHook codebase and CI/CD pipeline.
- Selection and setup of testing frameworks and tools.
- Existing documentation on project architecture and conventions.

## Implementation Notes

### Development Guidelines

- Follow MeshHook's coding standards and conventions.
- Use ES6+ features for clarity and performance.
- Prioritize testing critical paths and functionalities first.

### Testing Strategy

- **Unit Testing:** Focus on pure functions, especially within workers and utility modules.
- **Integration Testing:** Test the interaction between SvelteKit endpoints, Supabase services, and worker tasks.
- **E2E Testing:** Simulate user interactions in the DAG builder and webhook trigger functionalities.

### Security Considerations

- Include tests for RLS policies and secrets management.
- Validate input sanitization and output encoding to prevent injection attacks.

### Monitoring & Observability

Not directly applicable to automated testing but ensure logging and error reporting within tests are clear for easier troubleshooting.

## Related Documentation

- MeshHook PRD, Architecture, and Security Guidelines documents.
- GitHub Actions documentation for CI/CD setup.
- Testing frameworks' official documentation for setup and usage instructions.
