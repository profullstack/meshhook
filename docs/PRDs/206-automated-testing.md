# PRD: Automated Testing for MeshHook

## Overview

Automated testing is crucial for maintaining the high quality and reliability of the MeshHook project, a webhook-first, deterministic, Postgres-native workflow engine. This task aims to ensure that all features, especially new additions, adhere to the project's stringent requirements for security, performance, and functionality without introducing regressions or performance bottlenecks.

### Purpose

The purpose of this task is to implement a comprehensive automated testing suite that covers unit, integration, and end-to-end (E2E) tests. This suite will facilitate continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) processes, enabling faster and more reliable deployment cycles while ensuring the project's core functionalities, such as webhook triggers, visual DAG builder, durable runs, live logs, and multi-tenant RLS security, are consistently validated against regressions and bugs.

### Alignment with Project Goals

This task directly supports MeshHook's goals by:
- Ensuring the reliability and security of webhook triggers and signature verification.
- Validating the visual DAG builder's functionality and user interactions.
- Guaranteeing the durability and correctness of replayable runs.
- Confirming real-time capabilities of live logs via Supabase Realtime.
- Upholding multi-tenant RLS security standards.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

1. **Comprehensive Test Coverage:** Develop tests to cover >80% of the codebase, focusing on critical paths such as webhook processing, DAG execution, and user authentication.
2. **Automated Test Execution:** Integrate the testing suite with GitHub Actions to automatically run tests against every commit and pull request.
3. **Regression Testing:** Include tests to cover previously fixed bugs and critical issues to prevent regressions.
4. **Testing Documentation:** Create documentation for the testing suite, including how to write, run, and update tests.

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** Tests should be optimized to run quickly, aiming to not significantly impact CI/CD pipeline execution times.
- **Reliability:** Tests must be deterministic, reducing flakiness and ensuring consistent results across runs.
- **Security:** Testing should include validation of security features, including RLS and webhook signature verification.
- **Maintainability:** The testing framework and tests should be easy to update and extend as the project evolves.

## Technical Specifications

### Architecture Context

MeshHook is built on a stack that includes SvelteKit/Svelte 5 for the frontend, Supabase for backend services, and a combination of custom workers for background processing. The automated testing suite needs to integrate seamlessly across these components, validating their interaction and ensuring the reliability and security of the system as a whole.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Tool Selection:** Choose appropriate tools for unit testing (e.g., Jest), integration testing (e.g., Supertest), and E2E testing (e.g., Cypress or Playwright).
2. **Test Development:** Adopt a Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach to implement tests across all levels:
   - Unit tests for individual functions and components.
   - Integration tests to verify the interactions between different parts of the system.
   - E2E tests to simulate real-user scenarios and interactions with the system.
3. **CI/CD Integration:** Configure GitHub Actions to automatically execute the test suite on all pushes and pull requests, ensuring no breaking changes are merged.
4. **Documentation:** Update the project's documentation to include a new section on the automated testing strategy, guidelines for writing tests, and instructions for running and maintaining the test suite.

### Data Model Changes

No changes to the data model are anticipated specifically for the implementation of automated testing. Should any changes be required, they will be documented and reviewed as part of the development process.

### API Endpoints

While the task itself does not introduce new API endpoints, the testing suite will cover all existing endpoints to ensure they behave as expected under various conditions, validating both functionality and performance.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Automated tests cover >80% of the codebase.
- [ ] All automated tests pass consistently across different environments.
- [ ] CI/CD pipelines are configured to run the test suite on every push and pull request.
- [ ] Documentation for the testing suite is comprehensive, up-to-date, and accessible to all project contributors.
- [ ] Performance benchmarks for the test suite are established and met, ensuring tests do not significantly delay the CI/CD process.

## Dependencies and Prerequisites

- Access to the MeshHook codebase and CI/CD setup.
- Selection and setup of testing frameworks and tools compatible with the project's technology stack.
- Existing documentation on project architecture, coding standards, and security guidelines.

## Implementation Notes

### Development Guidelines

- Adhere to MeshHook's coding standards and best practices.
- Prioritize testing of critical paths and functionalities.
- Ensure tests are deterministic, reducing the potential for flaky tests.

### Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests:** Focus on individual components and functions, mocking dependencies as needed.
- **Integration Tests:** Test the interactions between different parts of the system, including database integration and worker processes.
- **E2E Tests:** Simulate real-world user scenarios, testing the system from end to end.

### Security Considerations

- Include tests specifically designed to validate security mechanisms, such as RLS rules, webhook signature verification, and data validation/sanitization.

### Monitoring and Observability

While not directly related to automated testing, ensure that test runs are logged and monitored, providing insights into test failures and performance metrics.
