# PRD: Automated Testing for MeshHook

## Overview

Automated testing within the MeshHook project is pivotal to ensuring the reliability, performance, and security of the webhook-first, deterministic, Postgres-native workflow engine. This task aligns with MeshHook's core objectives by validating that all components, including webhook triggers, visual DAG builder, durable runs, live logs, and multi-tenant RLS security, work as expected under various conditions. By implementing a comprehensive automated testing strategy, we aim to accelerate development, facilitate maintenance, and ensure a high-quality user experience.

## Objectives

- To implement a robust automated testing framework that covers unit, integration, and end-to-end (E2E) tests.
- To ensure that new changes do not break existing functionality.
- To automate regression testing and reduce manual testing efforts.
- To validate the system's performance, reliability, and security continuously.

## Functional Requirements

1. **Test Suite Setup**: Establish a testing framework compatible with the project's tech stack (Node.js, SvelteKit, Supabase, Postgres).
2. **Unit Testing**: Write unit tests for individual functions and components, focusing on the logic of webhook processing, DAG execution, and utility modules.
3. **Integration Testing**: Develop integration tests to verify the interactions between different components of the system, such as the workflow engine, database interactions, and external HTTP calls.
4. **End-to-End Testing**: Implement E2E tests to simulate user scenarios from webhook trigger to workflow completion, including error handling and retries.
5. **Continuous Integration (CI)**: Integrate the test suite with GitHub Actions to run tests automatically on push and pull requests.
6. **Test Coverage**: Achieve and maintain a high level of test coverage across the codebase. Define specific coverage targets for unit, integration, and E2E tests.
7. **Documentation**: Document test cases, scenarios, and the rationale behind them. Provide guidelines for writing new tests as part of feature development.

## Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance**: Ensure tests are optimized for speed to facilitate quick feedback cycles. Parallelize tests where possible.
- **Reliability**: Tests should be deterministic, with no false positives/negatives.
- **Security**: Include security-focused tests, verifying RLS implementations, input validation, and signature verification.
- **Maintainability**: Tests should be easy to update alongside changes in application logic. Follow clean code practices and ensure readability.

## Technical Specifications

### Architecture Context

MeshHook leverages a combination of SvelteKit (for SSR/API), Supabase (for Postgres, Realtime, and other services), and a worker-based architecture for orchestrating workflows. The automated testing strategy should integrate seamlessly across these components, validating both individual and integrated functionality.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Framework Selection**: Choose testing frameworks (e.g., Jest for unit/integration tests, Cypress for E2E tests) that align with the project's stack and requirements.
2. **Test Environment Setup**: Configure test databases, mock services, and any required environment variables.
3. **Unit Tests Implementation**: Start with writing unit tests for utility functions and components, following the Test-Driven Development (TDD) methodology.
4. **Integration Tests Development**: Focus on the interactions between system components, such as workflow execution and database interactions.
5. **E2E Tests Creation**: Simulate real user scenarios that cover the entire workflow process.
6. **CI Integration**: Configure GitHub Actions to trigger the test suite on code pushes and pull requests.
7. **Monitoring Test Coverage**: Use tools like Istanbul/nyc to monitor test coverage, aiming for predefined targets.

### Data Model Changes

No data model changes are required specifically for the implementation of automated testing. However, test databases should mirror the production schema as closely as possible.

### API Endpoints

Not applicable directly to automated testing, but tests should cover all existing and new API endpoints as part of integration and E2E tests.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] A complete suite of unit, integration, and E2E tests implemented.
- [ ] Test suite integrated with GitHub Actions for automated CI.
- [ ] Test coverage meets or exceeds the project's target thresholds.
- [ ] All tests pass consistently with no intermittent failures.
- [ ] Testing documentation updated with guidelines and scenarios.

## Dependencies

- Existing project components and database schema.
- Access to Supabase services for integration testing.
- Selection and setup of testing frameworks and tools.

## Implementation Notes

### Development Guidelines

- Follow the TDD approach for new features and bug fixes.
- Use clear, descriptive names for test cases and scenarios.
- Isolate tests to avoid dependencies between them.
- Mock external services to speed up testing and ensure reliability.

### Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests**: Focus on logic-heavy functions and components.
- **Integration Tests**: Cover the key workflows and component interactions.
- **E2E Tests**: Cover critical user journeys end-to-end.

### Security Considerations

- Include tests for authentication and authorization mechanisms.
- Validate input sanitization and signature verification functionalities.

### Monitoring & Observability

- Integrate test coverage reporting into the CI pipeline.
- Monitor flaky tests and improve test reliability continuously.

By following this PRD, MeshHook will establish a solid foundation for automated testing, ensuring the project's long-term success and reliability.
