# PRD: Contributing Guide

**Issue:** [#194: Contributing guide](https://github.com/profullstack/meshhook/issues/194)  
**Milestone:** Phase 8: Documentation  
**Labels:** developer-documentation, hacktoberfest  
**Phase:** Phase 8  
**Section:** Developer Documentation

## Overview

<<<<<<< HEAD
The Contributing Guide is a critical component of the MeshHook project's Developer Documentation, designed to streamline the onboarding process for new contributors and ensure a consistent development workflow. This guide will serve as a comprehensive blueprint for developers looking to contribute to MeshHook, aligning their efforts with the project's core goals and technical frameworks.

MeshHook aims to offer a robust, webhook-first, deterministic, Postgres-native workflow engine that combines the visual simplicity of n8n with the durability of Temporal, all under a permissive MIT license. The Contributing Guide will encapsulate this vision, providing clear instructions and standards for contributions that enhance the project's features, including webhook triggers, visual DAG building, durable runs, live logs, and multi-tenant security.
=======
The objective of this task is to develop a comprehensive Contributing Guide for the MeshHook project. This guide aims to standardize the contribution process, making it easier for developers to understand how they can contribute to the project effectively. Aligning with MeshHook's core goals, this document should facilitate contributions that enhance the project's webhook triggers, visual DAG builder, durability, live logging capabilities, and security features.

## Technical Specifications

### Architecture Context

<<<<<<< HEAD
The Contributing Guide does not directly impact the technical architecture but must align with MeshHook's current technical stack and workflows:
- **SvelteKit/Svelte 5** for front-end development.
- **Supabase** ecosystem for database (Postgres), real-time updates, and storage solutions.
- **Postgres-native** features for workflow engine capabilities.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Content Creation:** Draft the guide content, focusing on clarity and comprehensiveness.
2. **Peer Review:** Submit the draft for review by the project lead and select contributors.
3. **Incorporate Feedback:** Refine the guide based on received feedback.
4. **Publish:** Finalize the format (Markdown) and publish the guide in the project's `docs` directory.
5. **Announcement:** Announce the availability of the guide to the community through the project's communication channels.

### Data Model

N/A - This task does not require changes to the data model.

### API Endpoints

N/A - This task does not introduce new API endpoints.

## Acceptance Criteria
