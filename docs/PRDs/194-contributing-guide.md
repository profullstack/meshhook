# PRD: Contributing Guide

**Issue:** [#194: Contributing guide](https://github.com/profullstack/meshhook/issues/194)  
**Milestone:** Phase 8: Documentation  
**Labels:** developer-documentation, hacktoberfest  
**Phase:** Phase 8  
**Section:** Developer Documentation

## Overview

The objective of this task is to develop a comprehensive Contributing Guide for the MeshHook project. This guide aims to standardize the contribution process, making it easier for developers to understand how they can contribute to the project effectively. Aligning with MeshHook's core goals, this document should facilitate contributions that enhance the project's webhook triggers, visual DAG builder, durability, live logging capabilities, and security features.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

1. **Guide Structure:** Structure the guide to include introduction, setup instructions, contribution process, coding standards, and how to submit a pull request.
2. **Setup Instructions:** Provide detailed setup instructions for local development, including required software and environment setup.
3. **Contribution Process:** Outline the steps for making contributions, including branching strategies, commit message conventions, and pull request guidelines.
4. **Coding Standards:** Document coding standards specific to SvelteKit/Svelte 5, Postgres, and other technologies used in the project.
5. **Testing Guidelines:** Include guidelines for writing tests, along with how to run and verify them before submission.
6. **Documentation Standards:** Set expectations for documenting new features or changes to the API and codebase.

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **Usability:** The guide should be clear, concise, and easy to follow for contributors with various levels of experience.
- **Accessibility:** Ensure the contributing guide is accessible to a diverse group of developers, including those using assistive technologies.
- **Maintainability:** The guide should be easy to update as project standards and technologies evolve.

## Technical Specifications

### Architecture Context

The Contributing Guide does not directly impact the architecture of MeshHook but is crucial for maintaining the project's overall quality and consistency. It should align with the technical stack of MeshHook, including SvelteKit/Svelte 5 for the frontend, Postgres for data storage, and Supabase for real-time capabilities.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Research:** Review contributing guides from similar open-source projects to identify best practices.
2. **Drafting:** Start with a basic structure and iteratively add sections focusing on setup, contribution process, coding standards, testing, and documentation.
3. **Feedback Loop:** Share drafts with the core development team to gather feedback and make adjustments.
4. **Finalization:** Incorporate all feedback, ensuring the guide is comprehensive and aligns with project goals.
5. **Publishing:** Make the guide available in the project's repository and ensure it's easily discoverable for new contributors.
