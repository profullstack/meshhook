# PRD: Contributing Guide for MeshHook

## Overview

The task of creating a Contributing Guide for MeshHook is aimed at enhancing the project's developer documentation to facilitate a seamless onboarding process for new contributors. This guide is essential for maintaining the project's integrity, quality, and collaborative spirit. By providing clear, comprehensive instructions on how contributors can engage with the project, this guide aligns with MeshHook's overarching goals of simplicity, durability, and security in workflow automation.

### Purpose

- To standardize the contribution process, ensuring all contributions align with MeshHook's quality standards and architectural patterns.
- To foster a welcoming and inclusive community by providing clear guidelines on collaboration and communication.

## Functional Requirements

1. **Introduction:** Briefly explain the project's purpose, scope, and main features.
2. **Setting Up the Development Environment:** Provide step-by-step instructions to set up a local development environment, including required software, project clone, and environment setup.
3. **Code Contribution Workflow:** Detail the process for contributing code, from forking the repository to submitting a pull request.
4. **Style Guide:** Specify coding conventions for JavaScript/TypeScript, Svelte, and CSS to ensure code consistency.
5. **Community Standards:** Outline the expectations for behavior within the project community to foster a respectful and inclusive environment.

## Non-Functional Requirements

- **Accessibility:** The guide should be easily understandable by developers of all skill levels.
- **Maintainability:** Written in a way that allows for easy updates as the project or best practices evolve.
- **Consistency:** Should be consistent with existing documentation, both in style and substance.

## Technical Specifications

### Architecture Context

While the Contributing Guide itself does not alter the project's technical architecture, it must acknowledge and respect the established tools and practices, including:
- Front-end development with **SvelteKit/Svelte 5**.
- Backend and database interactions through **Supabase** and **Postgres**.
- Workflow engine specifics that rely on Postgres-native features.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Drafting:** Begin by drafting the guide, focusing on the functional requirements as outlined.
2. **Review:** The draft will then be reviewed by the project lead and key contributors for accuracy and completeness.
3. **Refinement:** Incorporate feedback from the review process, adjusting content for clarity and completeness.
4. **Publication:** Format the final draft in Markdown and add it to the project's `docs` directory.
5. **Announcement:** Share the new Contributing Guide with the community through official project communication channels.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Contributing Guide is added to the `docs` directory of the project repository.
- The guide includes sections for Introduction, Development Environment Setup, Contribution Process, Style Guide, and Community Standards.
- The guide is reviewed and approved by the project maintainers.
- New contributors report finding the guide helpful and clear.

## Dependencies

### Technical Dependencies

- Access to the project's existing documentation and repository to ensure consistency and accuracy.

### Prerequisite Tasks

- Compilation of any existing informal contribution guidelines or notes from the project team.

## Implementation Notes

### Development Guidelines

- Use inclusive language and consider the guide as a tool not just for code contributions but also for community building.
- Ensure Markdown formatting is consistent with existing documentation, for ease of reading and navigation.

### Testing Strategy

- Conduct a walkthrough of the guide with a new contributor to identify any gaps or unclear sections.
- Review the guide for language clarity and technical accuracy with both developers and non-developers from the project community.

### Security Considerations

- Highlight the importance of not committing sensitive information and adhering to security best practices in contributions.

### Monitoring & Observability

- N/A for this documentation task, but feedback mechanisms should be put in place to continually improve the guide based on contributor experiences.

This PRD provides a structured approach to creating a Contributing Guide that will serve as a foundational document for current and future contributors to the MeshHook project. By following this plan, the project team can ensure that the guide is informative, inclusive, and instrumental in fostering a vibrant developer community.
