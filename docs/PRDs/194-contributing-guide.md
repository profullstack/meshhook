# PRD: Contributing Guide

**Issue:** [#194](https://github.com/profullstack/meshhook/issues/194)  
**Milestone:** Phase 8: Documentation  
**Labels:** developer-documentation, hacktoberfest  
**Section:** Developer Documentation

---

## Overview

The Contributing Guide is a critical component of the MeshHook project's Developer Documentation, designed to streamline the onboarding process for new contributors and ensure a consistent development workflow. This guide will serve as a comprehensive blueprint for developers looking to contribute to MeshHook, aligning their efforts with the project's core goals and technical frameworks.

MeshHook aims to offer a robust, webhook-first, deterministic, Postgres-native workflow engine that combines the visual simplicity of n8n with the durability of Temporal, all under a permissive MIT license. The Contributing Guide will encapsulate this vision, providing clear instructions and standards for contributions that enhance the project's features, including webhook triggers, visual DAG building, durable runs, live logs, and multi-tenant security.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

1. **Guide Structure:** Organize the Contributing Guide into sections such as Introduction, Setting up the Development Environment, Code Contribution Workflow, Style Guide, and Community Standards.
2. **Development Environment:** Provide detailed setup instructions tailored to the project's tech stack (SvelteKit/Svelte 5, Supabase, Postgres).
3. **Contribution Process:** Outline the steps for submitting contributions, including fork creation, feature branching, commit messages, pull requests, and peer review.
4. **Style Guide:** Establish code style guidelines covering JavaScript/TypeScript, Svelte, and CSS conventions to ensure codebase consistency.
5. **Community Standards:** Include guidelines for respectful and constructive communication within the project community.

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **Accessibility:** Ensure the guide is clear, concise, and accessible to developers with varying levels of experience.
- **Maintainability:** Structure the guide for easy updates as the project evolves.
- **Consistency:** Align the guide with existing MeshHook documentation and coding practices.

## Technical Specifications

### Architecture Context

The Contributing Guide does not directly impact the technical architecture but must align with MeshHook's current technical stack and workflows:
- **SvelteKit/Svelte 5** for front-end development.
- **Supabase** ecosystem for database (Postgres), real-time updates, and storage solutions.
- **Postgres-native** features for workflow engine capabilities.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Content Creation:** Draft the guide content, focusing on clarity and comprehensiveness.
2. **Peer Review:** Submit the draft for review by the project lead and select contributors.
3. **Incorporate Feedback:** Refine the guide based on received feedback.
4. **Publish:** Finalize the format (Markdown) and publish the guide in the project's `docs` directory.
5. **Announcement:** Announce the availability of the guide to the community through the project's communication channels.
