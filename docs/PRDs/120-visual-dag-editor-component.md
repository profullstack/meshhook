# PRD: Visual DAG Editor Component

## Overview

The Visual Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) Editor Component is a crucial part of the MeshHook project's Workflow Builder section. This component is designed to enhance the user experience by providing a graphical interface for creating and managing workflows. By aligning this task with MeshHook's core goals, we aim to deliver a powerful and intuitive tool that simplifies workflow creation while maintaining the robustness and reliability MeshHook is known for.

### Purpose

- To provide a user-friendly interface for constructing and visualizing workflows.
- To facilitate the intuitive design of workflows with drag-and-drop functionality.
- To ensure the component integrates seamlessly with MeshHook's existing architecture and enhances its deterministic, Postgres-native capabilities.

### Alignment with Project Goals

The Visual DAG Editor Component directly supports MeshHook's goals by improving the visual simplicity of workflow creation and management, akin to n8n, while leveraging Temporal's durability features. This task is instrumental in realizing the vision of a webhook-first, deterministic workflow engine that is easy to use, highly reliable, and scalable.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

1. **Visual Workflow Design**: Users should be able to create, modify, and visualize workflows as a DAG with intuitive drag-and-drop functionality.
2. **Compatibility**: The component must be compatible with SvelteKit/Svelte 5, adhering to the current frontend technology stack.
3. **Workflow Node Support**: Support for creating and configuring the basic nodes (`transform`, `http_call`, `branch`, `delay`, `terminate`) via UI.
4. **Workflow Validation**: Real-time validation of workflow logic to prevent the creation of invalid workflows (e.g., circular dependencies, missing parameters).
5. **Integration**: Seamless integration with the backend for storing and retrieving workflow definitions and for executing workflows.

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance**: The editor should be highly responsive, with minimal lag in rendering and interaction, even for complex workflows.
- **Reliability**: The component must be robust, with comprehensive error handling to prevent crashes or data loss.
- **Security**: Adhere to MeshHook's security guidelines, ensuring that workflow data is protected and access is controlled via RLS.
- **Maintainability**: The code should be clean, well-documented, and follow the project's coding standards and best practices.

## Technical Specifications

### Architecture Context

- **Frontend**: SvelteKit/Svelte 5 for building the interactive DAG editor interface.
- **Backend**: Supabase/Postgres for storing workflow definitions and execution states.
- **Integration Points**:
  - Workflow CRUD operations via the existing API.
  - Real-time workflow execution status updates using Supabase Realtime.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Analysis**: Review the current MeshHook frontend and backend architecture to understand integration points.
2. **Design**:
   - Define the UI design and user interaction flow for the DAG editor.
   - Outline the component structure and data flow within the editor.
3. **Implementation**:
   - Develop the DAG editor component using SvelteKit/Svelte 5.
   - Implement the integration logic with the backend for CRUD operations.
   - Ensure responsive design for both desktop and mobile views.
4. **Testing**:
   - Perform unit and integration testing to ensure reliability and performance.
   - Conduct user acceptance testing (UAT) to validate usability.
5. **Documentation**:
   - Update the developer and API documentation to include details about the new component.

### Data Model

No changes to the existing data model are required for this task. Workflow definitions and execution states will continue to be stored in Supabase/Postgres as per the current schema.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Users can create and edit workflows using the Visual DAG Editor.
- [ ] The editor supports drag-and-drop functionality for adding and configuring nodes.
- [ ] Workflow changes are saved and persisted in the backend database.
- [ ] The component is responsive and performs well on both desktop and mobile devices.
- [ ] Code is well-documented, follows project conventions, and passes all linting checks.
- [ ] All new code is covered by unit tests, and integration tests verify the component works as expected.
- [ ] Security guidelines are adhered to, ensuring safe handling of workflow data.

## Dependencies

- SvelteKit/Svelte 5 for frontend development.
- Supabase for backend storage and real-time updates.
- Existing MeshHook frontend and backend codebase.

## Implementation Notes

### Development Guidelines

- Use the latest SvelteKit and Svelte 5 features to ensure the best developer experience and performance.
- Follow the TDD approach for a more reliable and maintainable codebase.
- Ensure the UI is accessible and follows web accessibility standards.

### Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests**: For individual components and utility functions.
- **Integration Tests**: To verify the interaction between the DAG editor and the backend services.
- **E2E Tests**: To simulate user workflows from creating to executing workflows.

### Security Considerations

- Ensure all data interactions comply with MeshHook's RLS policies.
- Validate and sanitize input from the DAG editor to prevent XSS or injection attacks.

### Monitoring & Observability

- Implement logging for key actions within the DAG editor component.
- Monitor performance metrics and optimize as necessary to meet the performance requirements.

This PRD outlines the development of the Visual DAG Editor Component, aligning with MeshHook's goals to provide a robust, user-friendly workflow engine. By adhering to this document, the development team will ensure the successful integration and deployment of this component, enhancing MeshHook's capabilities and user experience.
