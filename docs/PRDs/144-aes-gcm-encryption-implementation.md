# PRD: AES-GCM Encryption Implementation

## Overview

The AES-GCM encryption implementation is a critical feature for the MeshHook project, directly contributing to our goal of offering a secure, multi-tenant workflow engine. As part of Phase 4: Security, this task focuses on enhancing the security of stored secrets by adopting AES-GCM, an authenticated encryption algorithm that provides both data confidentiality and integrity. This aligns with our commitment to multi-tenant RLS security and secrets encryption, ensuring that sensitive data is protected at rest.

## Functional Requirements

1. **Encryption Mechanism**: Implement AES-GCM encryption for all secrets stored by MeshHook. This includes, but is not limited to, webhook secrets, access tokens, and any user-defined secrets within workflows.
2. **Key Management**: Implement a Key Encryption Key (KEK) management system, allowing for regular rotation of KEKs without losing access to data encrypted with previous keys.
3. **API for Encryption and Decryption**: Provide internal API methods for encrypting and decrypting data, ensuring these methods can be easily utilized wherever secrets management is required in the MeshHook codebase.
4. **Migration Path**: Develop a secure migration path for existing secrets to be encrypted with AES-GCM, ensuring zero data loss and minimal service interruption.
5. **Utility Functions**: Include utility functions for generating secure nonces for AES-GCM, as this is crucial for maintaining the security guarantees of AES-GCM.

## Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance**: The encryption and decryption operations must be optimized for performance, ensuring minimal impact on request processing times.
- **Security**: Adhere to best practices in cryptographic implementations, avoiding common pitfalls such as insecure nonce usage or key management flaws.
- **Reliability**: Ensure that the encryption system is robust, with fail-safes in place to prevent data loss or corruption.
- **Maintainability**: Write clear, well-documented code with an emphasis on maintainability and ease of understanding, following the project's established coding standards.

## Technical Specifications

### Architecture Context

MeshHook leverages a combination of SvelteKit for front-end interactions, Supabase for backend services including Postgres for data storage, and a distributed system of workers for task execution. The AES-GCM encryption feature will primarily interact with the components responsible for secrets management and storage within the Supabase Postgres database.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Analysis**: Review the current secrets storage mechanism to identify all areas where encryption needs to be integrated.
2. **Design**:
   - Define a schema for storing encrypted secrets along with their nonces and associated KEK identifiers.
   - Design the KEK management system, including database schema for KEK storage and rotation logic.
3. **Implementation**:
   - Develop the encryption/decryption API, incorporating AES-GCM and KEK management.
   - Implement utility functions for nonce generation and secure storage of encryption metadata.
   - Integrate the encryption API into existing secrets management workflows.
   - Create a migration tool/script for encrypting existing secrets.
4. **Testing**: Perform thorough testing, including unit, integration, and end-to-end tests, to ensure the encryption system functions correctly across all scenarios.
5. **Documentation**: Update internal documentation to reflect the new encryption mechanism and provide guidelines for developers on using the encryption API.
6. **Review & Deployment**: Conduct a code review with the team and prepare for deployment, including planning any required downtime for secret migration.

### Data Model Changes

- `encrypted_secrets` table:
  - `id` SERIAL PRIMARY KEY
  - `project_id` INT REFERENCES projects(id)
  - `encrypted_data` BYTEA
  - `nonce` BYTEA
  - `kek_id` INT REFERENCES kek(id)
  
- `kek` table:
  - `id` SERIAL PRIMARY KEY
  - `key` BYTEA
  - `created_at` TIMESTAMP

### API Endpoints

- No new external API endpoints required for this task.
- Internal APIs for encrypt/decrypt operations will be added to the project's service layer.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] AES-GCM encryption implemented for all new and existing secrets.
- [ ] KEK management system operational with the ability to rotate keys without data loss.
- [ ] Migration tool/scripts developed and tested for encrypting existing secrets.
- [ ] Encryption and decryption operations meet performance benchmarks.
- [ ] All unit and integration tests pass, ensuring encryption system reliability.
- [ ] Documentation updated to include details on the encryption implementation and usage.
- [ ] Security audit completed with no major issues found.

## Dependencies

- Access to the current MeshHook codebase and database schema.
- Supabase Postgres for database changes.
- Security libraries supporting AES-GCM (e.g., Node.js crypto module).

## Implementation Notes

### Development Guidelines

- Use Node.js' built-in `crypto` module for AES-GCM operations to avoid additional dependencies.
- Follow TDD principles by writing tests before implementing the encryption logic.
- Ensure that all encryption operations are asynchronous to avoid blocking the event loop.

### Testing Strategy

- Implement unit tests for all new utility functions and API methods.
- Integration tests should cover the encryption and decryption workflow, including key rotation.
- Performance tests to measure the impact of encryption on processing times.

### Security Considerations

- Ensure secure generation and storage of nonces for AES-GCM to prevent reuse.
- Follow best practices for key management, including secure storage and regular rotation of KEKs.
- Conduct a thorough security review of the implementation to identify potential vulnerabilities.

### Monitoring & Observability

- Monitor the performance of encryption and decryption operations to identify potential bottlenecks.
- Log key rotation events and any encryption-related errors for auditability.

By adhering to this PRD, the MeshHook project will enhance its security posture through the secure management of secrets, aligning with our goal of providing a reliable, secure, and user-friendly workflow engine.
