# PRD: JWT Token Support for Webhook Triggers

## Overview

This Product Requirements Document (PRD) details the addition of JWT (JSON Web Token) token support for webhook triggers in the MeshHook project. This feature is a critical enhancement for Phase 5: Webhook System, aimed at bolstering security by enabling the verification of JWT tokens for incoming webhook requests. This aligns with MeshHook's overarching goals of providing a secure, scalable, and user-friendly workflow automation platform. JWT token support will ensure that only authenticated and authorized requests trigger workflows, enhancing the security posture of the MeshHook platform.

## Functional Requirements

1. **JWT Verification:** The system must be able to verify the JWT attached to incoming webhook requests to authenticate and authorize these requests.
2. **Configurable JWT Secrets:** Users must be able to configure JWT secret keys and expected claims through both a UI and an API endpoint for each webhook trigger in their project.
3. **Dynamic Secret Fetching:** The system should support dynamic fetching of JWT secrets from the project's secrets vault, allowing secrets to be updated without redeploying or restarting services.
4. **Error Handling and Feedback:** Clear, actionable error responses should be provided for verification failures, and these should be logged appropriately for auditing purposes.
5. **User Interface for JWT Configuration:** Implement a user-friendly interface within the existing project settings to allow users to configure JWT settings for webhook triggers.

## Non-Functional Requirements

1. **Performance:** The JWT verification process must be optimized to ensure minimal impact on webhook processing latency.
2. **Security:** Implement secure storage and access mechanisms for JWT secrets and ensure robust validation of JWT signatures and claims to prevent security vulnerabilities.
3. **Reliability:** The webhook processing system, including JWT verification, should aim for 99.9% uptime.
4. **Maintainability:** The implementation should follow the project's existing coding standards, ensuring the code is clean, well-documented, and easy to maintain.

## Technical Specifications

### Architecture Context

- **Integration Points:**
  - The feature will be integrated into the SvelteKit frontend for configuration interfaces and the existing webhook processing pipeline for JWT verification.
  - Supabase Postgres will store JWT configuration settings.
- **Technologies:**
  - Use Node.js and a reputable JWT library for the verification process.
  - SvelteKit/Svelte 5 for frontend changes.
  - Supabase Realtime for logging.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Extend Webhook Configuration:**
   - Update the `webhook_triggers` table schema to include a `jwt_config` JSONB column.
   - Design and implement UI changes in the SvelteKit frontend for JWT configuration.
2. **Implement JWT Verification:**
   - Integrate JWT verification into the webhook processing pipeline, ensuring the JWT is verified against the configured secret and claims before proceeding with the trigger.
   - Implement dynamic secret fetching logic, interfacing with the secrets vault as needed.
3. **Logging and Monitoring:**
   - Implement detailed logging for all verification attempts and outcomes.
   - Utilize Supabase Realtime to monitor these logs.

### Data Model Changes

- `webhook_triggers` table will have a new `jwt_config` JSONB column to store JWT verification configurations, including secrets and claims.

### API Endpoints

- **New Endpoint:** `/api/v1/projects/{projectId}/webhooks/{webhookId}/jwt-config`
  - **Method:** `PUT`
  - **Body:** 
    ```json
    {
      "secret": "string",
      "claims": {
        "iss": "example.com",
        "aud": "meshhook"
      }
    }
    ```

## Acceptance Criteria

- JWT verification correctly authenticates and authorizes incoming requests for all configured webhook triggers.
- Users can configure JWT settings via both UI and API.
- Dynamic secret fetching is functional and tested.
- Unit and integration tests cover new functionality, maintaining a code coverage rate above 90%.
- Documentation is updated to reflect JWT configuration and verification processes.

## Dependencies

- Access to a secure and maintained JWT library compatible with the project's Node.js version.
- Coordination with the frontend team for UI changes.

## Implementation Notes

### Development Guidelines

- Adhere to the project's existing coding conventions, utilizing ESLint and Prettier for code formatting.
- Follow Test-Driven Development (TDD) practices to ensure comprehensive test coverage from the outset.

### Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests:** Focus on isolated testing of JWT verification logic, configuration parsing, and dynamic secret fetching.
- **Integration Tests:** Ensure end-to-end testing of the webhook processing pipeline with JWT verification in place.
- **Manual Testing:** Conduct thorough manual testing of the UI and API for JWT configuration to ensure a seamless user experience.

### Security Considerations

- Securely manage JWT secrets, ensuring they are only accessible to necessary components and are encrypted at rest.
- Thoroughly validate JWT signatures and claims to mitigate potential security threats.

### Monitoring & Observability

- Implement detailed logging for all JWT verification attempts, capturing both successes and failures.
- Leverage Supabase Realtime for real-time monitoring of these logs, facilitating quick response to potential issues.
