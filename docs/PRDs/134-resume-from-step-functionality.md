# PRD: "Resume from step" functionality

**Issue:** [#134](https://github.com/profullstack/meshhook/issues/134)  
**Milestone:** Phase 3: Frontend (SvelteKit)  
**Labels:** run-console  
**Phase:** Phase 3  
**Section:** Run Console

## Overview

The "Resume from step" functionality is a critical feature designed to enhance the user experience and operational resilience of the MeshHook workflow engine. This feature aligns with MeshHook's core goals by improving the engine's ability to handle failures and allowing users to manually intervene and resume workflow execution from a specific step after addressing any issues. This capability is essential for maintaining high reliability and flexibility in workflow management, especially in complex or long-running processes that may encounter intermittent issues.

### Purpose

To allow users to resume a workflow execution from a specific failed or paused step, thereby improving error recovery and reducing manual intervention time.

### Alignment with Project Goals

- **Durability:** Enhances the engine's robustness by making workflow runs more recoverable.
- **Usability:** Improves the user experience by providing more control over workflow execution.
- **Security and Multi-Tenancy:** Ensures that the feature adheres to the project's security model, including RLS and audit logging.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

1. Users must be able to select a failed or paused step in the Run Console and initiate a "resume from step" action.
2. The system must validate user permissions before allowing the action to proceed.
3. The workflow engine must accurately restore the workflow state to the point of the selected step.
4. The feature must support multi-tenant environments, ensuring that users can only resume steps within their authorized projects.

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** The "resume from step" action must complete within a reasonable time frame, aiming for sub-second response times where possible.
- **Reliability:** This feature must have a 99.9% uptime, with comprehensive error handling to manage and log failures gracefully.
- **Security:** Implement RLS and audit logging for each "resume from step" action to ensure compliance with MeshHook's security model.

## Technical Specifications

### Architecture Context

MeshHook utilizes a combination of SvelteKit for the frontend and Supabase (Postgres, Realtime) for the backend services. The "resume from step" functionality involves interaction between these components and the workflow execution engine.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Analysis:** Examine the current state management and execution flow of workflow runs to identify the best approach for implementing state restoration.
2. **Design:** Outline the UI changes needed in the Run Console for the "resume from step" functionality, including permission checks and state restoration logic.
3. **Implementation:** Develop the functionality, ensuring integration with existing authentication and authorization mechanisms.
   - Modify the workflow execution engine to support state restoration.
   - Update the UI to allow users to select a step and initiate the resume action.
4. **Testing:** Implement unit and integration tests to cover new functionality and ensure no regressions in the execution engine.
5. **Documentation:** Update user and API documentation to reflect the new feature.

### Data Model Changes

No immediate changes required to the existing data models. Any adjustments discovered during implementation should be documented and reviewed.

### API Endpoints

No new API endpoints required. Existing endpoints may need adjustments to support state restoration actions.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Users can select a failed or paused step and initiate a "resume from step" action.
- [ ] The system validates user permissions before resuming a step.
- [ ] Workflow state is accurately restored to the point of the selected step.
- [ ] The feature is compatible with the multi-tenant RLS security model.
- [ ] All unit and integration tests pass.
- [ ] Documentation is updated to reflect the new functionality.

## Dependencies

### Technical Dependencies

- SvelteKit and Supabase services for frontend and backend integration.
- Workflow execution engine for state management and execution flow.

### Prerequisite Tasks

- Ensure user authentication and authorization mechanisms are in place and functional.
- Confirm that the workflow execution engine's state management supports partial state restoration.

## Implementation Notes

### Development Guidelines

- Follow existing coding standards and patterns for the SvelteKit frontend and backend integrations.
- Use TDD principles to guide development, ensuring comprehensive test coverage.

### Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests:** Focus on the logic for state restoration and permission validation.
- **Integration Tests:** Cover interactions between the frontend, the backend services, and the workflow execution engine.

### Security Considerations

- Implement RLS and audit logging for the "resume from step" actions.
- Ensure that state restoration does not expose sensitive information or bypass security controls.

### Monitoring & Observability

- Integrate logging for the "resume from step" actions to monitor usage and identify potential issues.
- Track metrics related to the performance and reliability of the feature.
