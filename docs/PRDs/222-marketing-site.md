**Owner:** Anthony Ettinger (Profullstack)  
**License:** MIT

## Overview

As MeshHook approaches its launch phase, a compelling marketing site is crucial to communicate its value proposition, features, and differentiators effectively to the target audience. This site will serve as the primary digital touchpoint for prospective users, providing insights into MeshHook’s capabilities, including webhook triggers with signature verification, a visual DAG builder, and multi-tenant RLS security, among others.

**Objective:** Develop a marketing site that aligns with MeshHook's branding and technical sophistication, showcasing its features and benefits to engage and convert site visitors into users.

## Functional Requirements

1. **Content Creation:** Develop web content that outlines MeshHook’s features, advantages, and use cases.
2. **Design and Branding:** Implement a responsive web design that is consistent with MeshHook's branding guidelines.
3. **Feature Highlight:** Integrate interactive sections to demonstrate the visual DAG builder and live logs capabilities.
4. **Lead Generation:** Incorporate a contact form for lead generation and inquiries.
5. **SEO Optimization:** Ensure the site is optimized for search engines to improve visibility.
6. **Analytics:** Integrate web analytics to track visitor behavior and conversions.

## Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** Achieve a sub-2-second load time for all pages on the site.
- **Reliability:** Ensure 99.9% site uptime outside of scheduled maintenance windows.
- **Security:** Implement secure handling and storage of user data collected through the site.
- **Maintainability:** Code should be clean, well-documented, and easy to update with new content or features.

## Technical Specifications

### Architecture Context

- **Frontend:** SvelteKit for a dynamic, server-side rendered experience.
- **Hosting/CDN:** Supabase Edge for global content delivery and performance.
- **Analytics:** Plausible for privacy-friendly, GDPR-compliant web analytics.
- **SEO:** Implementation of structured data (schema.org) for enhanced search engine visibility.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Design Mockups:** Create and approve web design mockups that align with MeshHook's branding.
2. **Content Development:** Collaborate with product and marketing teams to develop engaging content.
3. **Development:**
   - Setup SvelteKit project with TypeScript and ESLint/Prettier for code quality.
   - Implement responsive UI based on approved design mockups.
   - Develop interactive demos for the DAG builder and live logs feature.
4. **SEO and Analytics Setup:**
   - Configure Plausible for analytics.
   - Implement SEO best practices, including meta tags and structured data.
5. **Testing and Optimization:**
   - Conduct performance testing and optimization (e.g., image optimization, lazy loading).
   - Ensure accessibility and responsive design across devices.
6. **Launch:**
   - Set up domain and SSL.
   - Deploy site to Supabase Edge.
7. **Post-Launch:**
   - Monitor site performance and user feedback.
   - Iterate based on analytics and user suggestions.

### Data Model

No changes to the existing MeshHook data model are required for this task.

### API Endpoints

No new API endpoints are required for this task. However, the contact form will utilize a serverless function for submissions, which will temporarily store data in Supabase before being processed and moved to a CRM or email marketing service.
