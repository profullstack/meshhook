## 1. Overview

The creation of a marketing site for MeshHook is a crucial step in the project's Phase 10: Polish & Launch. This site will serve as the primary online presence for MeshHook, aiming to effectively communicate the project's unique value proposition, features, and benefits to potential users and stakeholders. As MeshHook positions itself as a webhook-first, deterministic, Postgres-native workflow engine, the marketing site needs to highlight its strengths, including its visual DAG builder, durable runs, live logs, and multi-tenant RLS security, in a manner that resonates with our target audience of indie builders, automation engineers, and platform teams.

**Objective:** Develop a marketing site that encapsulates MeshHook's essence, showcases its features, and encourages adoption by demonstrating its superiority over alternatives through clear, engaging content and a compelling user experience.
