# PRD: Implementing and Testing Retry Logic for MeshHook

## Overview

### Purpose

This document outlines the requirements and approach for implementing and testing the retry logic within MeshHook's HTTP Executor. By ensuring the retry mechanism is robust and efficient, MeshHook aims to enhance its reliability and performance, especially in handling transient errors in HTTP actions. This task is crucial for maintaining the high standards of durability and resilience expected from MeshHook.

### Alignment with Project Goals

- **Reliability and Durability:** By addressing transient failures effectively, the retry logic directly contributes to MeshHook's goal of providing a reliable and durable workflow engine.
- **Security:** The implementation will ensure that retry attempts do not compromise security, aligning with MeshHook's commitment to secure operations.
- **Performance:** The task aims to optimize the retry mechanism to prevent negative impacts on system performance, supporting the goal of maintaining high performance under varying conditions.

## Functional Requirements

1. **Retry Mechanism:** Implement an effective retry mechanism within the HTTP Executor, using exponential backoff combined with jitter to mitigate the risk of simultaneous retries (thundering herd problem).
2. **Configurability:** Users should be able to configure the maximum number of retries and the base delay interval for retries, ensuring flexibility across different use cases.
3. **Error Handling:** Implement comprehensive error handling for scenarios where the maximum number of retries is exceeded, including appropriate logging and user notification mechanisms.
4. **Test Coverage:** Develop a comprehensive suite of unit tests to validate the following:
   - Immediate success on the first attempt.
   - Success after one or more retries.
   - Failure after exceeding the maximum number of retries.
   - Correct application of user-configured retry parameters.
5. **Integration Testing:** Conduct integration tests to simulate real-world transient failures and validate the retry logic's effectiveness and integration with the broader system.

## Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** The retry logic should not cause significant degradation in system performance, even under high load or frequent retry scenarios.
- **Reliability:** The system should demonstrate at least 99.9% reliability in handling and recovering from transient failures, attributed to the retry logic.
- **Security:** Ensure that retry operations do not inadvertently expose sensitive information or introduce new security vulnerabilities.

## Technical Specifications

### Architecture Context

- **Component:** This task focuses on the HTTP Executor component within the Workers module of MeshHook.
- **Integration Points:** The retry logic will integrate closely with the Workflow Engine for initiating HTTP requests and the Logging and Monitoring systems for auditing retry attempts and outcomes.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Code Review:** Begin with a thorough review of the HTTP Executor's existing implementation to identify the best integration points for the retry logic.
2. **Retry Logic Design:** Design the retry algorithm, incorporating exponential backoff with jitter. Use flowcharts or pseudocode for initial visualization.
3. **Parameter Configuration:** Extend the `http_call` node's schema to include retry configuration parameters, such as `max_retries` and `backoff_delay`.
4. **Implementation:** Code the retry logic within the HTTP Executor, adhering to MeshHook's coding standards and best practices.
5. **Unit Testing:** Write unit tests for all scenarios identified in the functional requirements, ensuring comprehensive coverage.
6. **Integration Testing:** Create tests that simulate transient network failures to ensure the retry logic performs as expected in real-world scenarios.
7. **Documentation:** Update MeshHook's documentation to accurately describe the retry functionality and configuration options.
8. **Peer Review:** Submit the implementation for peer review, addressing feedback to refine the approach.

### Data Model Changes

- No direct changes to the core data model are expected. Configuration for retry parameters will be incorporated within the existing `http_call` node definition.

### API Endpoints

- This task does not introduce new API endpoints.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Implementation of retry logic within the HTTP Executor is complete and functional.
- [ ] All unit tests pass, covering the specified scenarios.
- [ ] Integration tests confirm the retry mechanism's effectiveness in simulated transient failure conditions.
- [ ] Documentation accurately reflects the new retry capabilities and configuration procedures.
- [ ] Performance benchmarks confirm no significant impact on system responsiveness due to the retry implementation.
- [ ] The code review process concludes with approval and no outstanding major concerns.

## Dependencies and Prerequisites

- Access to MeshHook's current codebase and development environment.
- Understanding of the HTTP Executor component and workflow engine integration.
- Availability of testing tools and environments for simulating transient network failures.

## Implementation Notes

### Development Guidelines

- Use the existing JavaScript (ES2024+) coding standards and ESM module system.
- Apply Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles for the retry logic's implementation.
- Adhere to ESLint and Prettier configurations to maintain code quality and consistency.

### Testing Strategy

- **Unit Testing:** Emphasize isolated testing to validate the retry logic under various failure scenarios.
- **Integration Testing:** Ensure the retry logic integrates seamlessly with other system components and performs as expected in an end-to-end context.

### Security Considerations

- Carefully review retry logic to ensure that sensitive information is not logged or exposed through retry attempts.
- Evaluate the retry configuration to prevent potential Denial of Service (DoS) attacks by setting sensible limits on retry attempts and backoff intervals.

### Monitoring & Observability

- Implement detailed logging for each retry attempt, capturing key information such as the reason for the retry and the attempt count.
- Monitor key metrics related to retries, including success rates and failure rates, to identify potential issues or areas for improvement.
