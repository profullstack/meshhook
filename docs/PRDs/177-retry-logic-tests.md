# PRD: Retry Logic Tests for MeshHook

## Overview

This PRD outlines the requirements and approach for implementing and testing the retry logic within MeshHook, a webhook-first, deterministic, Postgres-native workflow engine. The retry logic is a crucial component of the HTTP Executor, ensuring robustness and reliability in webhook delivery and HTTP requests through retries and backoff strategies. This task aligns with MeshHook's goals of providing a durable, reliable, and secure workflow engine, addressing the need for resilience in the face of transient failures.

### Purpose

To ensure that MeshHook's retry mechanism for HTTP requests is reliable, efficient, and fails gracefully, enhancing the overall robustness of the system.

### Alignment with Project Goals

- **Reliability and Durability:** Ensures workflows can recover from transient errors in HTTP actions.
- **Security:** Verifies that retry logic does not expose sensitive information or lead to security vulnerabilities.
- **Performance:** Optimizes retry intervals to maintain system performance under failure conditions.

## Functional Requirements

1. **Retry Mechanism Implementation:** Implement a retry mechanism for the HTTP Executor that utilizes exponential backoff with jitter to minimize the thundering herd problem.
2. **Configurable Retry Parameters:** Allow users to configure the maximum number of retry attempts and the initial backoff interval for each `http_call` node.
3. **Failure Handling:** Implement logic to handle maximum retry attempts exceeded, including logging and optional notification on failure.
4. **Unit Tests:** Develop unit tests covering the following scenarios:
   - Successful request on the first attempt.
   - Successful request after one or more retries.
   - Exceeded maximum retry attempts without success.
   - Configuration of retry parameters.
5. **Integration Tests:** Develop integration tests that simulate transient network failures and verify that the retry mechanism behaves as expected.

## Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** Ensure that the retry mechanism does not significantly degrade system performance or response times.
- **Reliability:** Achieve 99.9% reliability in handling transient failures through the retry mechanism.
- **Security:** Ensure that retry attempts do not expose sensitive information or lead to security vulnerabilities.

## Technical Specifications

### Architecture Context

- **Component:** HTTP Executor within the Workers module.
- **Integration Points:** 
  - Workflow Engine for initiating HTTP requests based on workflow definitions.
  - Logging and Monitoring systems for tracking retry attempts and failures.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Review Existing Code:** Understand the current implementation of the HTTP Executor and identify areas for integration.
2. **Design Retry Logic:** Design the retry mechanism, including exponential backoff with jitter, using pseudocode or flowcharts.
3. **Configuration:** Extend the `http_call` node schema to include retry parameters (max attempts, initial backoff interval).
4. **Coding:** Implement the retry logic within the HTTP Executor, following best practices and project coding standards.
5. **Unit Testing:** Write unit tests for each scenario outlined in the functional requirements.
6. **Integration Testing:** Develop integration tests that simulate transient network failures.
7. **Documentation:** Update the project documentation to include information on the retry mechanism and configuration options.
8. **Review and Feedback:** Submit the implementation for code review and incorporate feedback.

### Data Model Changes

No direct changes to the data model are required for the implementation of retry logic tests. Configuration for retries will be stored within the existing structure of the workflow definitions.

### API Endpoints

No new API endpoints are required for this task.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Retry logic correctly implemented within the HTTP Executor component.
- [ ] Unit tests cover all outlined scenarios and pass successfully.
- [ ] Integration tests simulate transient failures and verify retry behavior.
- [ ] Documentation accurately reflects the retry mechanism and configuration options.
- [ ] No degradation in performance due to the retry implementation.
- [ ] Code review approved with no major issues.

## Dependencies and Prerequisites

- Access to the existing MeshHook codebase and development environment.
- Familiarity with the project's existing HTTP Executor and workflow engine architecture.
- Required services (e.g., Supabase, Postgres) accessible for testing purposes.

## Implementation Notes

### Development Guidelines

- Follow the ESM module system and use modern JavaScript (ES2024+) features.
- Utilize TDD (Test-Driven Development) for the retry logic implementation.
- Ensure code adheres to ESLint and Prettier configurations for consistency and maintainability.

### Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests:** Focus on isolated testing of the retry logic under various scenarios.
- **Integration Tests:** Ensure that the retry mechanism integrates correctly with the workflow engine and behaves as expected in a simulated environment.

### Security Considerations

- Verify that retry attempts do not inadvertently log or expose sensitive information.
- Ensure that configurations for retries do not open up potential for DoS (Denial of Service) attacks due to excessive retrying.

### Monitoring & Observability

- Implement logging for each retry attempt, including the reason for the retry and the attempt number.
- Monitor key metrics related to retry attempts, success rates, and failure rates to identify potential issues or areas for optimization.
