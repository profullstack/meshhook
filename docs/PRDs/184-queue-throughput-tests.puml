Queue -up-> DB : uses
TestFramework .right.> LoadGen : configures
LoadGen .down.> Queue : simulates load
Queue --> Metrics : reports
Metrics --> TestFramework : analyzes
TestFramework --> Monitoring : logs performance
Monitoring --> DB : stores logs

note right of LoadGen
  Simulate realistic and\npeak load conditions
end note

note right of Metrics
  Collect throughput,\nlatency, and resource usage
end note

note over TestFramework, Queue
  Test scenarios include\nvarying load patterns and\ndata volumes
end note

note over Monitoring
  Track system performance\nand behavior during tests
