# PRD: Caching Strategy

## Overview

The objective of this task is to design and implement a caching strategy for MeshHook to improve the performance and efficiency of our webhook-first, deterministic, Postgres-native workflow engine. This strategy should align with MeshHook's core features such as webhook triggers, visual DAG builder, durable runs, live logs, and multi-tenant security while optimizing response times and reducing database load.

## Functional Requirements

1. **Caching Mechanism**: Implement a caching mechanism that reduces repetitive database queries, especially for frequently accessed data such as workflow definitions, node configurations, and execution states.
2. **Invalidation Strategy**: Design and implement an invalidation strategy to ensure data consistency between the cache and the database. This must handle updates, deletions, and insertions.
3. **Configuration and Management**: Provide mechanisms for configuring cache parameters (e.g., size, eviction policies, TTL) and for managing the cache (e.g., manual invalidation, monitoring usage).
4. **Integration**: Seamlessly integrate the caching strategy with existing components, ensuring that all data flows respect the new cache layer without introducing breaking changes.

## Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance**: Ensure that the caching strategy significantly reduces response times for user-facing operations and decreases database load without introducing memory bloat.
- **Reliability**: The caching mechanism must guarantee data consistency and support fallback mechanisms to handle cache misses or failures gracefully.
- **Security**: Caching should not introduce new security vulnerabilities, especially in the context of multi-tenancy and sensitive data (e.g., secrets).
- **Maintainability**: Implement the caching strategy in a way that is easy to understand, monitor, and extend by other developers.

## Technical Specifications

### Architecture Context

MeshHook is built using SvelteKit for SSR/API interactions, with Supabase (Postgres) as the backend for data storage and queues, and worker processes for orchestration and HTTP execution. The caching strategy should be integrated such that it complements this existing architecture, particularly focusing on the interaction with Postgres and how data is fetched and mutated by the application's various components.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Analysis**: Evaluate the current system to identify high-impact areas for caching (e.g., webhook processing, workflow execution).
2. **Design**:
   - Select appropriate caching technology (in-memory vs. distributed cache) based on system requirements and deployment scenarios.
   - Define cache keys and structure for different types of data.
   - Design the invalidation logic to ensure data consistency.
3. **Implementation**:
   - Integrate caching library/framework with the existing codebase.
   - Implement caching logic for identified high-impact areas.
   - Ensure that the invalidation strategy is properly applied across data mutations.
4. **Testing**: Write tests to verify both the performance improvements and the data consistency between cache and database.
5. **Monitoring**: Implement monitoring for cache hit rates, load, and evictions to inform future tuning.

### Data Model

No direct changes to the data model are anticipated for this task. However, monitoring and logging tables for cache operations may be introduced if necessary for observability and troubleshooting.

### API Endpoints

No new API endpoints are required for this task. Existing endpoints may see performance improvements as a result of the caching strategy.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Caching mechanism implemented and integrated with existing components.
- [ ] Invalidation strategy in place ensuring data consistency.
- [ ] Configuration and management tools for the cache are provided.
- [ ] Performance improvements documented and verified through testing.
- [ ] No security vulnerabilities introduced by caching strategy.
- [ ] Documentation updated to include caching strategy details and usage.
- [ ] All new code is well-tested and follows existing coding standards.

## Dependencies

- Decision on caching technology (in-memory vs. distributed).
- Existing system architecture and component design.

## Implementation Notes

### Development Guidelines

- Follow existing project patterns for modularity and readability.
- Ensure all cached data handling respects multi-tenant security models.
- Use environment variables for configurable parameters to ease deployment and scaling.

### Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests**: Cover new caching logic and invalidation mechanisms.
- **Integration Tests**: Test caching integration points with existing system components.
- **Performance Tests**: Compare key workflows with and without caching to document improvements.

### Security Considerations

- Ensure cached data is scoped correctly to avoid data leaks between tenants.
- Consider encryption for sensitive data in cache, if using a distributed cache solution.

### Monitoring & Observability

- Implement metrics for cache hit/miss ratios, load, and memory usage.
- Use logging to capture cache invalidation and error events for troubleshooting.

By addressing these requirements and considerations, the caching strategy for MeshHook should enhance system performance, maintain data consistency, and integrate seamlessly with the existing architecture and workflows.
