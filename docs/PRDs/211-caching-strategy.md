# PRD: Caching Strategy for MeshHook

## Overview

The purpose of this task, as part of Phase 10: Performance Optimization, is to design and implement a caching strategy for MeshHook. This strategy aims to enhance the performance of our webhook-first, deterministic, Postgres-native workflow engine by reducing database load and optimizing response times. This initiative aligns with MeshHook's goals by improving efficiency without compromising on its core features, such as secure webhook triggers, a visual DAG builder, durable runs, live logs, and multi-tenant security.

## Functional Requirements

1. **Caching Implementation**: Integrate a caching layer that intercepts and reduces repetitive database queries for high-traffic data, including but not limited to workflow definitions, execution logs, and node configurations.
   
2. **Data Invalidation and Consistency**: Develop a robust invalidation strategy that ensures the cache remains consistent with the underlying database. This includes mechanisms to handle updates, deletions, and insertions effectively.

3. **Cache Management Tools**: Provide tools or interfaces for managing cache behavior, including setting time-to-live (TTL) values, cache eviction policies, and manual cache invalidation capabilities.

4. **Seamless Integration**: Ensure the caching layer integrates smoothly with existing MeshHook components, maintaining the current system architecture and data flow patterns.

## Non-Functional Requirements

1. **Performance**: The caching strategy should significantly reduce database query times and server response times, thereby enhancing the overall user experience.
   
2. **Reliability**: Implement failover and recovery mechanisms to ensure that operations continue smoothly in the event of a cache miss or cache service failure.

3. **Security**: Ensure that the caching implementation does not introduce new security vulnerabilities, particularly in relation to sensitive data handling and access control.

4. **Maintainability**: Code related to caching should be modular, well-documented, and easy to extend or modify to meet future requirements.

# PRD: Caching Strategy

## Overview

The objective of this task is to design and implement a caching strategy for MeshHook to improve the performance and efficiency of our webhook-first, deterministic, Postgres-native workflow engine. This strategy should align with MeshHook's core features such as webhook triggers, visual DAG builder, durable runs, live logs, and multi-tenant security while optimizing response times and reducing database load.

## Functional Requirements

1. **Caching Mechanism**: Implement a caching mechanism that reduces repetitive database queries, especially for frequently accessed data such as workflow definitions, node configurations, and execution states.
2. **Invalidation Strategy**: Design and implement an invalidation strategy to ensure data consistency between the cache and the database. This must handle updates, deletions, and insertions.
3. **Configuration and Management**: Provide mechanisms for configuring cache parameters (e.g., size, eviction policies, TTL) and for managing the cache (e.g., manual invalidation, monitoring usage).
4. **Integration**: Seamlessly integrate the caching strategy with existing components, ensuring that all data flows respect the new cache layer without introducing breaking changes.

## Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance**: Ensure that the caching strategy significantly reduces response times for user-facing operations and decreases database load without introducing memory bloat.
- **Reliability**: The caching mechanism must guarantee data consistency and support fallback mechanisms to handle cache misses or failures gracefully.
- **Security**: Caching should not introduce new security vulnerabilities, especially in the context of multi-tenancy and sensitive data (e.g., secrets).
- **Maintainability**: Implement the caching strategy in a way that is easy to understand, monitor, and extend by other developers.

## Technical Specifications

### Architecture Context

<<<<<<< HEAD
MeshHook utilizes SvelteKit for its frontend and API layers, with Supabase providing backend services including Postgres for data storage, queues, and real-time updates. Considering this architecture, the caching strategy will need to be compatible with Postgres and should enhance the interactions between SvelteKit components and the database.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Select Caching Technology**: Evaluate and select an appropriate caching solution (e.g., Redis, Memcached) that fits our scalability and performance needs.

2. **Identify Caching Opportunities**: Analyze the system to pinpoint data retrieval operations that will benefit most from caching, focusing on frequently accessed and read-heavy data.

3. **Develop Caching Logic**: Implement caching logic around identified opportunities, ensuring to handle cache population on misses and invalidation on data changes.
=======
MeshHook is built using SvelteKit for SSR/API interactions, with Supabase (Postgres) as the backend for data storage and queues, and worker processes for orchestration and HTTP execution. The caching strategy should be integrated such that it complements this existing architecture, particularly focusing on the interaction with Postgres and how data is fetched and mutated by the application's various components.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Analysis**: Evaluate the current system to identify high-impact areas for caching (e.g., webhook processing, workflow execution).
2. **Design**:
   - Select appropriate caching technology (in-memory vs. distributed cache) based on system requirements and deployment scenarios.
   - Define cache keys and structure for different types of data.
   - Design the invalidation logic to ensure data consistency.
3. **Implementation**:
   - Integrate caching library/framework with the existing codebase.
   - Implement caching logic for identified high-impact areas.
   - Ensure that the invalidation strategy is properly applied across data mutations.
4. **Testing**: Write tests to verify both the performance improvements and the data consistency between cache and database.
5. **Monitoring**: Implement monitoring for cache hit rates, load, and evictions to inform future tuning.

4. **Invalidate Cache**: Develop a coherent strategy for cache invalidation that aligns with data update patterns within MeshHook, ensuring data consistency.

<<<<<<< HEAD
5. **Monitoring and Management**: Implement monitoring tools to observe cache performance, including hit rates and eviction rates, and create management tools for cache invalidation and parameter tuning.

### Data Model Changes

No immediate changes to the data model are required for the implementation of a caching layer. However, monitoring and performance metrics related to caching may necessitate logging or metric collection tables in the future.
