# PRD: Caching Strategy for MeshHook

## Overview

The purpose of this task, as part of Phase 10: Performance Optimization, is to design and implement a caching strategy for MeshHook. This strategy aims to enhance the performance of our webhook-first, deterministic, Postgres-native workflow engine by reducing database load and optimizing response times. This initiative aligns with MeshHook's goals by improving efficiency without compromising on its core features, such as secure webhook triggers, a visual DAG builder, durable runs, live logs, and multi-tenant security.

## Functional Requirements

1. **Caching Implementation**: Integrate a caching layer that intercepts and reduces repetitive database queries for high-traffic data, including but not limited to workflow definitions, execution logs, and node configurations.
   
2. **Data Invalidation and Consistency**: Develop a robust invalidation strategy that ensures the cache remains consistent with the underlying database. This includes mechanisms to handle updates, deletions, and insertions effectively.

3. **Cache Management Tools**: Provide tools or interfaces for managing cache behavior, including setting time-to-live (TTL) values, cache eviction policies, and manual cache invalidation capabilities.

4. **Seamless Integration**: Ensure the caching layer integrates smoothly with existing MeshHook components, maintaining the current system architecture and data flow patterns.

## Non-Functional Requirements

1. **Performance**: The caching strategy should significantly reduce database query times and server response times, thereby enhancing the overall user experience.
   
2. **Reliability**: Implement failover and recovery mechanisms to ensure that operations continue smoothly in the event of a cache miss or cache service failure.

3. **Security**: Ensure that the caching implementation does not introduce new security vulnerabilities, particularly in relation to sensitive data handling and access control.

4. **Maintainability**: Code related to caching should be modular, well-documented, and easy to extend or modify to meet future requirements.

## Technical Specifications

### Architecture Context

MeshHook utilizes SvelteKit for its frontend and API layers, with Supabase providing backend services including Postgres for data storage, queues, and real-time updates. Considering this architecture, the caching strategy will need to be compatible with Postgres and should enhance the interactions between SvelteKit components and the database.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Select Caching Technology**: Evaluate and select an appropriate caching solution (e.g., Redis, Memcached) that fits our scalability and performance needs.

2. **Identify Caching Opportunities**: Analyze the system to pinpoint data retrieval operations that will benefit most from caching, focusing on frequently accessed and read-heavy data.

3. **Develop Caching Logic**: Implement caching logic around identified opportunities, ensuring to handle cache population on misses and invalidation on data changes.

4. **Invalidate Cache**: Develop a coherent strategy for cache invalidation that aligns with data update patterns within MeshHook, ensuring data consistency.

5. **Monitoring and Management**: Implement monitoring tools to observe cache performance, including hit rates and eviction rates, and create management tools for cache invalidation and parameter tuning.

### Data Model Changes

No immediate changes to the data model are required for the implementation of a caching layer. However, monitoring and performance metrics related to caching may necessitate logging or metric collection tables in the future.

### API Endpoints

This task will not introduce new API endpoints but will enhance the performance of existing endpoints by reducing direct database query load.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Caching layer implemented and integrated with existing MeshHook components without disrupting current functionality.
- [ ] Database query load significantly reduced for identified high-traffic operations.
- [ ] Cache invalidation strategy in place, ensuring data consistency across the application.
- [ ] Tools for cache management developed, allowing for easy monitoring and adjustment of caching parameters.
- [ ] No security vulnerabilities introduced through the caching implementation.
- [ ] Documentation updated to include details of the caching strategy, implementation, and management.

## Dependencies

- Selection of a caching technology compatible with our current stack and deployment environment.
- Current understanding and documentation of high-traffic and read-heavy operations within MeshHook.

## Implementation Notes

### Development Guidelines

- Follow existing coding standards and architectural patterns within the MeshHook project.
- Ensure all cached data is securely handled, especially regarding multi-tenant data separation.
- Use environment variables for caching configuration to facilitate easy adjustments in different environments.

### Testing Strategy

- Implement unit and integration tests covering new caching logic and invalidation strategies.
- Conduct performance testing to compare operation times with and without caching.

### Security Considerations

- Ensure that cached data is appropriately isolated in multi-tenant environments.
- Securely handle any sensitive information that may be cached, adhering to existing security practices.

### Monitoring & Observability

- Utilize monitoring tools to track cache hit/miss ratios, cache size, and evictions.
- Ensure that any cache-related errors or anomalies are logged for further investigation.

By following this PRD, MeshHook will achieve a significant performance improvement through the careful implementation of a caching strategy, enhancing the overall efficiency and user experience of the platform.
