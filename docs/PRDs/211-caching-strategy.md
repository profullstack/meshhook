# PRD: Caching Strategy

**Issue:** [#211](https://github.com/profullstack/meshhook/issues/211)  
**Milestone:** Phase 10: Polish & Launch  
**Labels:** performance-optimization, hacktoberfest  
**Phase:** Phase 10  
**Section:** Performance Optimization

---

## Overview and Objectives

This PRD outlines the approach for implementing a caching strategy within the MeshHook project. The primary objective of this caching strategy is to enhance the performance of the MeshHook workflow engine by reducing database read operations and improving response times for frequently accessed data. This aligns with the project's goal of maintaining sub-second response times for user-facing operations and supports the overall performance optimization efforts in Phase 10.

**Key Objectives:**
- Reduce latency and improve the efficiency of workflow execution.
- Decrease the load on the database by minimizing redundant data fetch operations.
- Ensure cache consistency and accuracy of the data served.

## Functional Requirements

1. **Cache Implementation:** Introduce caching for frequently accessed data, such as workflow definitions, webhook configurations, and user session information.
2. **Cache Invalidation:** Implement a strategy for invalidating cached data when the underlying data changes, ensuring consistency.
3. **Cache Configuration:** Allow configurable cache settings, including TTL (Time To Live) values for different types of data.
4. **Fallback Mechanism:** Ensure a fallback mechanism to retrieve data from the database in case of cache misses.

## Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** The caching strategy should significantly reduce data retrieval times and database load, contributing to overall system performance.
- **Reliability:** Implement robust error handling to manage cache failures gracefully, ensuring system reliability.
- **Security:** Ensure that cached data respects the project's multi-tenant RLS security model, preventing data leaks between tenants.
- **Maintainability:** Leverage existing technologies and follow project conventions for easy maintenance and extensibility of the caching mechanism.

## Technical Specifications

### Architecture Context

MeshHook leverages SvelteKit for its SSR/API layer and Supabase for backend services including Postgres, Realtime, and Storage. The caching strategy must integrate seamlessly into this architecture, enhancing performance without compromising the system's integrity or security.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Evaluation:** Identify the most frequently accessed data entities that would benefit from caching.
2. **Technology Selection:** Choose an appropriate caching technology (e.g., Redis, Memcached) that integrates well with the current stack.
3. **Design:** Develop a caching layer that interfaces between the application logic and data storage, implementing cache set, get, and invalidate operations.
4. **Integration:** Integrate the caching layer with existing components, ensuring that data retrieval operations first check the cache before falling back to the database.
5. **Testing and Optimization:** Perform thorough testing to ensure the effectiveness of the caching strategy and optimize configuration parameters for best performance.

### Data Model

No direct changes to the existing data model are required for the implementation of a caching strategy. However, monitoring and logging tables for cache hits, misses, and performance metrics may be introduced as needed.

### API Endpoints

No new API endpoints are required. Existing endpoints will be modified to utilize the caching layer for data retrieval.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Caching layer implemented and integrated with existing components.
- [ ] Configuration options for TTL and other cache parameters are exposed and documented.
- [ ] Cache invalidation strategy implemented ensuring data consistency.
- [ ] Fallback mechanism in place for handling cache misses.
- [ ] Performance benchmarks indicate a significant reduction in database read operations and improved response times.
- [ ] No regression in security, specifically in tenant data isolation.
- [ ] Documentation updated to include details of the caching strategy, configuration, and operation.

## Dependencies and Prerequisites

- Selection and setup of caching technology (e.g., Redis, Memcached).
- Review and understanding of existing data access patterns within MeshHook.

## Implementation Notes

### Development Guidelines

- Adhere to the project's coding standards and best practices.
- Ensure that all interactions with the cache are abstracted behind a well-defined interface to allow for future changes in caching technology.

### Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests:** Cover the caching layer logic including set, get, and invalidate operations.
- **Integration Tests:** Test the integration of the caching layer with existing components, verifying that data retrieval follows the cache-first approach.
- **Performance Tests:** Benchmark system performance with and without the caching layer to quantify the improvements.

### Security Considerations

- Ensure cached data is scoped and isolated per tenant, respecting the RLS model.
- Secure the caching infrastructure against unauthorized access.

### Monitoring & Observability

- Implement monitoring for cache hits, misses, and related performance metrics.
- Set up alerts for critical cache-related failures or significant drops in cache hit rates.
