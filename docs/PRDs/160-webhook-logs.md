# PRD: Webhook Logs Enhancement

## Overview

The enhancement of the Webhook Logs feature is a critical component in Phase 5 of the MeshHook project, specifically within the Webhook System. This task focuses on expanding the capabilities of logging, searching, and real-time monitoring of webhook events. By providing detailed visibility into webhook activities, this feature aims to significantly improve the debugging and auditing capabilities for users, aligning with MeshHook's goals of offering a robust, secure, and user-friendly workflow engine.

### Objectives:

- Enhance the logging of webhook events to include more detailed information for auditing and debugging purposes.
- Improve the user interface for searching and filtering webhook logs, making it easier for users to find specific events.
- Implement real-time updates to the webhook logs view, ensuring users have immediate visibility into webhook activities.

## Functional Requirements

1. **Detailed Logging**: Each webhook event should be logged with comprehensive details, including request and response headers, request and response bodies, status codes, execution times, and any errors encountered.
2. **Enhanced Search and Filter**: The Webhook Management UI must support advanced filtering options, including filtering by execution time, error presence, and specific request or response content.
3. **Real-time Log Viewing**: Implement a mechanism to push log updates to the Webhook Management UI in real-time, allowing users to observe webhook activities as they happen.
4. **Log Retention Policy Configuration**: Allow users to configure log retention policies, specifying how long logs should be retained before automatic deletion.

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **Scalability**: The logging system must handle a high volume of webhook events without significant performance degradation.
- **Security**: Ensure that logs do not expose sensitive information, applying MeshHook's existing security standards for data handling and storage.
- **Usability**: The UI for viewing and filtering logs must be intuitive and responsive, providing a seamless experience for users.

## Technical Specifications

### Architecture Context

- **Supabase Realtime**: Utilized for pushing log updates to the UI in real-time.
- **Postgres**: Serves as the backend for storing detailed log information, requiring schema updates to accommodate new log details.
- **SvelteKit/Svelte 5**: The frontend framework for developing the enhanced Webhook Management UI.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Database Schema Update**:
   - Modify the `webhook_logs` table schema to include new columns for detailed request and response information, execution time, and error details.
2. **Backend Enhancements**:
   - Update the webhook processing logic to capture and store detailed log information.
   - Implement new API endpoints for fetching logs with advanced filtering capabilities.
   - Develop a background process for handling log retention based on user-configured policies.
3. **Frontend Enhancements**:
   - Design and implement new UI components for displaying detailed log information and real-time updates.
   - Add advanced filtering options to the logs view.
4. **Integration with Supabase Realtime**:
   - Set up Supabase Realtime channels to stream log updates to the frontend in real-time.

### Data Model Changes

- Modifications to `webhook_logs`:
  - Add columns: `execution_time`, `error_details`.

### API Endpoints

- New/Updated Endpoints:
  - `GET /api/webhooks/{webhook_id}/logs/advanced`: Fetch logs with advanced filtering options.
  - `POST /api/webhooks/{webhook_id}/logs/retention`: Configure log retention policies.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Detailed logging of webhook events is implemented and includes all required information.
- [ ] The Webhook Management UI supports advanced filtering and displays logs in real-time.
- [ ] Users can configure log retention policies through the UI.
- [ ] The log retention background process operates as expected, deleting logs based on configured policies.
- [ ] New functionalities are well-documented.

## Dependencies

### Technical Dependencies

- Access to the current MeshHook infrastructure, including Supabase for Real-time functionality and Postgres for data storage.
- SvelteKit setup for frontend development.

### Prerequisite Tasks

- Review and validation of the current Webhook Management System's capabilities.
- Confirmation of the integration capability with Supabase Realtime for real-time log updates.

## Implementation Notes

### Development Guidelines

- Adhere to MeshHook's coding standards and architectural patterns.
- Implement modular, testable, and reusable code.
- Ensure backward compatibility with existing webhook log features.

### Testing Strategy

- Develop comprehensive unit and integration tests for new backend functionalities and API endpoints.
- Implement frontend tests to ensure UI components render correctly and interact with the backend as expected.
- Conduct end-to-end testing to validate real-time log updates and log retention functionalities.

### Security Considerations

- Ensure detailed logs do not store or display sensitive information.
- Implement access controls to restrict log viewing to authorized users only.

### Monitoring & Observability

- Monitor the performance and reliability of the log streaming and retention features.
- Set up appropriate alerts for any operational issues encountered with the logging system.
