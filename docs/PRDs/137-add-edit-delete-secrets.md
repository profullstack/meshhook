# PRD: Add/Edit/Delete Secrets

## Overview

This PRD outlines the requirements and implementation strategy for adding, editing, and deleting secrets within the MeshHook project. This feature is a crucial component of the Secrets Management section and aligns with MeshHook's goal of providing a secure, multi-tenant, deterministic workflow engine. Secrets management enables secure storage and usage of sensitive information like API keys, passwords, and tokens, essential for executing webhooks and workflows securely.

## Functional Requirements

1. **Add Secrets:**
   - Users must be able to add new secrets.
   - Each secret should include a name (unique within a project), value, and an optional description.
   - Secrets must be encrypted before storage.

2. **Edit Secrets:**
   - Users must be able to edit existing secrets.
   - Editing a secret includes changing its value and/or description.
   - The name of a secret cannot be changed after creation; it must be deleted and re-added if a name change is necessary.

3. **Delete Secrets:**
   - Users must be able to delete existing secrets.
   - Deletion should be secure and ensure that the secret cannot be recovered from storage.

4. **UI/UX:**
   - Implement a user-friendly interface for managing secrets within the SvelteKit frontend.
   - Provide feedback to the user after operations are completed (e.g., success or error messages).

5. **API Integration:**
   - Support API operations for adding, editing, and deleting secrets through secure endpoints.

## Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** Secret management operations should complete within a reasonable timeframe, not exceeding 2 seconds under normal load.
- **Security:** 
  - Implement robust encryption for secret storage.
  - Ensure API endpoints for secrets management are protected against unauthorized access.
- **Reliability:** Guarantee a high availability of the secrets management feature, aiming for 99.9% uptime.
- **Maintainability:** Code should be clean, well-documented, and easy to maintain.

## Technical Specifications

### Architecture Context

- MeshHook utilizes SvelteKit for frontend operations, Supabase for backend storage, and a combination of serverless functions for executing workflows.
- Secrets management will integrate with these components, requiring updates primarily to the SvelteKit frontend and the Supabase database schema.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Analysis:**
   - Review the existing architecture to determine the best approach for integrating secrets management.
   
2. **Design:**
   - Update the database schema to include a table for storing secrets with fields for name, value, description, and project_id.
   - Design secure API endpoints for adding, editing, and deleting secrets.
   - Sketch out the UI changes required for managing secrets.

3. **Implementation:**
   - Implement the backend logic for secrets management, including encryption and decryption operations.
   - Develop the frontend UI for adding, editing, and deleting secrets.
   - Integrate the frontend with the backend through secure API calls.

4. **Testing:**
   - Write unit and integration tests covering all new functionalities.
   - Perform manual testing to ensure the feature works as expected in the development environment.

### Data Model Changes

- New table: `secrets`
  - Columns: `id`, `name`, `encrypted_value`, `description`, `project_id`, `created_at`, `updated_at`
  - `project_id` links to the projects table to ensure multi-tenancy support.

### API Endpoints

- **Add Secret:** `POST /api/secrets`
- **Edit Secret:** `PUT /api/secrets/{secretId}`
- **Delete Secret:** `DELETE /api/secrets/{secretId}`

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Users can add new secrets through the UI, with the secrets being encrypted before storage.
- [ ] Users can edit the value and/or description of existing secrets through the UI.
- [ ] Users can delete secrets through the UI.
- [ ] All secret management operations are reflected in the UI without needing to refresh the page.
- [ ] API endpoints for adding, editing, and deleting secrets are secured and functional.
- [ ] Unit and integration tests cover new functionality.
- [ ] The feature has been manually tested and verified in a development environment.

## Dependencies

- Access to the Supabase project for database schema updates.
- SvelteKit setup for frontend development.

## Implementation Notes

### Development Guidelines

- Follow the existing coding standards for JavaScript and Svelte.
- Encrypt secrets using AES-GCM, ensuring that the encryption keys are securely managed.
- Write tests before implementing new functionalities (TDD approach).

### Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests:** Cover individual functions, particularly encryption and decryption logic.
- **Integration Tests:** Ensure that the API endpoints interact correctly with the database and the frontend.
- **Manual Testing:** Verify the user experience in the development environment, ensuring that secrets can be added, edited, and deleted seamlessly.

### Security Considerations

- Implement AES-GCM for encryption of secret values.
- Secure API endpoints using authentication and authorization mechanisms.
- Rotate encryption keys periodically.

### Monitoring & Observability

- Log operations related to secrets management, including additions, edits, and deletions.
- Monitor API response times and error rates for secrets management endpoints.

This PRD lays out a clear roadmap for implementing a secure, efficient, and user-friendly secrets management feature within the MeshHook project, aligning with the project's overarching goals and technical architecture.
