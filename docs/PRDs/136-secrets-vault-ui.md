# PRD: Secrets Vault UI

**Issue:** [#136](https://github.com/profullstack/meshhook/issues/136)  
**Milestone:** Phase 3: Frontend (SvelteKit)  
**Labels:** secrets-management  
**Phase:** Phase 3  
**Section:** Secrets Management

---

## Overview

The Secrets Vault UI is a critical component of the MeshHook project's Phase 3 development, focusing on Secrets Management. This task aims to provide a secure, user-friendly interface for managing secrets within the MeshHook platform. The interface will enable users to add, remove, and manage secrets that are crucial for the operation of webhook workflows, ensuring these secrets are handled securely and in compliance with the project's security guidelines.

This initiative aligns with MeshHookâ€™s overarching goals by enhancing the platform's usability and security, particularly in managing sensitive information required for webhook triggers and workflow executions.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

1. **Secrets Management:** Users must be able to create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) secrets within the vault.
2. **UI Components:** Develop reusable Svelte 5 UI components for the secrets management interface.
3. **Responsive Design:** The UI must be responsive, ensuring usability across desktop and mobile devices.
4. **UI/UX Consistency:** Adhere to existing UI/UX design patterns and styling conventions established in the MeshHook project.
5. **API Integration:** Interface must integrate seamlessly with backend API endpoints for secrets management.
6. **Documentation:** Provide comprehensive documentation for all public APIs and interfaces used or created as part of this task.

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** Ensure the UI is performant, with operations completing in sub-second times where possible.
- **Reliability:** Achieve 99.9% uptime for the secrets management feature, with robust error handling and recovery processes.
- **Security:** Adhere to MeshHook's security guidelines, including proper handling and masking of secrets both in transit and at rest.
- **Maintainability:** The codebase should be clean, well-documented, and easy to maintain, adhering to project-wide coding standards and best practices.

## Technical Specifications

### Architecture Context

The Secrets Vault UI will be developed within the SvelteKit framework, leveraging its SSR (Server-Side Rendering) and API capabilities. Integration points include:

- **Supabase:** For storing and retrieving secrets in a secure, encrypted format.
- **Workers:** Orchestrator and HTTP Executor components may need to interact with the secrets for processing webhook events and executing HTTP requests.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Analysis:** Conduct a thorough review of the existing codebase and identify how the secrets management UI will integrate with backend services.
2. **Design:** Draft detailed design documents outlining:
   - UI component design and interaction flow.
   - Data structures for UI state management.
   - API contracts for interacting with backend services.
   - Security measures for handling secrets within the UI.
3. **Implementation:** Develop the UI following a TDD (Test-Driven Development) approach, ensuring components are fully tested at the unit and integration levels before deployment.
4. **Integration:** Integrate the UI with backend services, ensuring seamless data flow and error handling.
5. **Testing:** Perform comprehensive testing, covering all functional and non-functional requirements.
6. **Documentation:** Update project documentation to reflect the new secrets management UI features and API endpoints.
7. **Review and Deployment:** Conduct code reviews and merge approved changes for deployment.

### Data Model

No immediate changes to the data model are anticipated for this task. However, adjustments may be necessary to accommodate new UI features or API requirements. Any changes should be documented and reviewed as part of the implementation process.

### API Endpoints

- **GET** `/api/secrets`: Retrieve a list of secrets.
- **POST** `/api/secrets`: Create a new secret.
- **PUT** `/api/secrets/{secretId}`: Update an existing secret.
- **DELETE** `/api/secrets/{secretId}`: Delete a secret.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] CRUD operations for secrets can be performed through the UI.
- [ ] UI components are reusable and consistent with MeshHook design standards.
- [ ] The secrets management interface is responsive and user-friendly across devices.
- [ ] Backend integration is seamless, with real-time updates and error handling.
- [ ] All code is well-documented, and new API endpoints are documented.
- [ ] Security guidelines are strictly followed, ensuring the safe handling of secrets.
- [ ] Performance benchmarks are met, with operations completing efficiently.

## Dependencies

- **Technical Dependencies:** SvelteKit framework, Supabase services, existing MeshHook backend services.
- **Prerequisite Tasks:** Ensure all required services are accessible, and any dependent features or APIs are completed and operational.

## Implementation Notes

### Development Guidelines

- Utilize the ESM module system and adopt modern JavaScript features for development.
- Ensure comprehensive error handling throughout the UI, particularly in scenarios involving secret management.

### Testing Strategy

- Implement unit tests for new components and services.
- Conduct integration tests to verify interactions between the UI and backend services.
- Perform manual testing to validate user experience and responsiveness.

### Security Considerations

- Implement strict access controls and authentication checks.
- Ensure all secrets are encrypted in transit and at rest.
- Adhere to best practices for managing and accessing secrets within the application.

### Monitoring & Observability

- Implement logging for key actions and errors within the secrets management process.
- Monitor performance metrics and set up alerts for any operational anomalies.
