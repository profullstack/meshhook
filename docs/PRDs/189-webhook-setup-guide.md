## 1. Overview

The objective of this task is to develop a comprehensive webhook setup guide for MeshHook users, aligning with the project's core functionalities such as webhook triggers with signature verification, durable, replayable runs, and multi-tenant RLS security. This document serves as a foundational component of user documentation, aiming to enhance user experience by providing clear, actionable instructions for setting up and managing webhooks effectively.

### Purpose

- To facilitate users in seamlessly integrating MeshHook's webhook functionality into their workflows.
- To ensure users can leverage webhook triggers with signature verification confidently.
- To embody MeshHook's principles of simplicity, durability, and security in user documentation.

## 2. Functional Requirements

1. **Content Creation:** Develop a detailed, step-by-step webhook setup guide covering:
   - Introduction to webhook concepts within MeshHook.
   - Instructions for creating and configuring webhook triggers.
   - Guidance on signature verification setup and best practices.
2. **Visual Aids:** Include screenshots and diagrams to illustrate the setup process and configurations.
3. **Example Use Cases:** Provide practical examples of webhook use cases in common scenarios.
4. **Security Best Practices:** Outline security considerations for webhook setup, focusing on signature verification.
5. **Troubleshooting Section:** Address common issues and their resolutions.
6. **Feedback Mechanism:** Incorporate a method for readers to provide feedback on the documentation.

## 3. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Usability:** Ensure the guide is user-friendly, employing clear, concise language accessible to both technical and non-technical users.
- **Accessibility:** Adhere to web accessibility standards to ensure the guide is usable by people with disabilities.
- **Maintainability:** Write the guide in a modular fashion to facilitate easy updates as the project evolves.

## 4. Technical Specifications

### Architecture Context

The guide will be integrated into the existing SvelteKit-based user documentation system, utilizing Markdown for content management and deployment via the project's static site generation pipeline.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Content Drafting:** Collaborate with the development team to outline the scope and details of webhook functionalities.
2. **Visual Content Creation:** Design and capture screenshots/diagrams using tools that align with MeshHook's visual identity guidelines.
3. **Documentation Writing:** Author the guide in Markdown, incorporating visual content and example code snippets where applicable.
4. **Review and Iteration:** Conduct internal reviews with the project team for technical accuracy and user-friendliness.
5. **Deployment:** Integrate the final guide into the MeshHook documentation site, following the project's content deployment workflows.

### Data Model

Not applicable for this task as it focuses on documentation without altering the data model.

### API Endpoints

Not applicable as this task does not involve API endpoint creation or modification.

## 5. Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Webhook setup guide is comprehensive, covering all required topics listed in the functional requirements.
- [ ] Documentation includes visual aids and example use cases for better understanding.
- [ ] Guide adheres to MeshHook's style and usability standards, with clear, accessible language.
