# PRD: API Documentation for MeshHook

## Overview

The purpose of this Product Requirements Document (PRD) is to outline the development of comprehensive API documentation for MeshHook. This documentation is essential for ensuring developers can effectively utilize MeshHook's capabilities to integrate and manage webhook-driven workflows. The API documentation aims to align with MeshHook's overarching goals of delivering a user-friendly, robust, and secure webhook-first workflow engine by providing clear, accurate, and detailed information about its API endpoints. This effort is part of Phase 8: Documentation, under the milestone labeled developer-documentation and hacktoberfest.

## Objectives

- Facilitate ease of use and integration for developers by providing detailed API documentation.
- Enhance the reliability and security understanding through clear documentation of MeshHook's functionalities.
- Support MeshHook's mission by enabling developers to build and manage webhook-driven workflows more efficiently.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

1. **Documentation Scope:** Cover all public API endpoints, including webhook triggers, workflow management, version publications, and run consoles.
2. **Content Clarity and Accuracy:** Provide clear, accurate descriptions, request/response formats, and examples for each endpoint.
3. **Searchability and Usability:** Ensure the documentation is easily navigable, with a functional search feature to quickly find information.
4. **Version Control:** Implement versioning in the documentation to track changes and updates, allowing users to reference documentation for different versions of the API.

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** Guarantee high availability and fast loading times for the documentation site.
- **Maintainability:** Establish a streamlined process for updating the documentation in conjunction with API changes.
- **Security:** Detail security practices, including managing authentication, secrets, and webhook verification.

## Technical Specifications

### Architecture Context

MeshHook utilizes SvelteKit for SSR/API services, Supabase for backend operations, and dedicated workers for orchestration and HTTP execution. The API documentation will take these components into account, providing specific guidance on interacting with MeshHook's API effectively.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Select Documentation Tools:** Opt for tools like Swagger or OpenAPI for generating and hosting the API documentation, ensuring support for automatic updates and versioning.
2. **Develop Documentation Template:** Create a standard template for API documentation that includes sections for endpoint descriptions, request/response examples, error codes, and security guidelines.
3. **Populate Documentation:** Fill in the template with comprehensive information on all public API endpoints, following MeshHook's coding and API design standards.
4. **Internal Review and Beta Feedback:** Conduct a thorough review with the development team and a round of feedback collection from select beta users to refine the documentation.
5. **Documentation Hosting:** Choose a hosting solution that aligns with the performance and accessibility requirements, making the API documentation available to developers.
6. **Establish a Maintenance Workflow:** Implement a maintenance plan for keeping the documentation up to date with ongoing API changes, including a strategy for versioning.

### Data Model and API Endpoints

The API documentation will detail existing API endpoints, providing specifics on methods, paths, request parameters, examples, and error codes. Key endpoints include:

- **Webhook Triggers:** `/api/webhook/{project_id}/{workflow_id}`
- **Workflow Management:** `/api/workflows/{project_id}`
- **Version Publication:** `/api/workflows/{project_id}/{workflow_id}/versions`
- **Run Console:** `/api/runs/{run_id}`

## Acceptance Criteria

- Comprehensive documentation for all public API endpoints is available.
- Documentation provides examples, request/response formats, and security practices.
- The documentation is easily accessible, with high availability and quick navigation.
- Feedback from internal and external reviews confirms the clarity and completeness of the documentation.
- A maintenance plan for the documentation is established and operational.

## Dependencies and Prerequisites

- Access to MeshHook's current API codebase and development team for accurate information gathering.
- Selection of a documentation platform or tool that meets the project's requirements.
- Coordination with MeshHook's security team to ensure correct representation of security practices.

## Implementation Notes

### Development Guidelines

- Adhere to the OpenAPI specification for a standardized approach to API documentation.
- Provide realistic examples that cover typical use cases to aid understanding.
- Use clear, concise language to explain functionality, particularly when describing complex operations.

### Testing Strategy

- Test all documentation examples against the actual API to verify accuracy.
- Perform usability testing with developers unfamiliar with MeshHook to identify areas for improvement.

### Security Considerations

- Highlight authentication, authorization, and secure webhook verification processes.
- Clearly indicate the security requirements for each endpoint, including required permissions.

### Monitoring & Observability

- Implement analytics on the documentation platform to monitor usage, identify popular sections, and gather insights on search trends for continuous improvement.

By following this PRD, MeshHook will develop and maintain comprehensive, user-friendly API documentation that supports developers in integrating and maximizing the workflow engine's capabilities.
