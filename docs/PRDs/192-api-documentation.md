# PRD: API Documentation for MeshHook

**Issue:** [#192](https://github.com/profullstack/meshhook/issues/192)  
**Milestone:** Phase 8: Documentation  
**Labels:** developer-documentation, hacktoberfest  
**Phase:** Phase 8  
**Section:** Developer Documentation  

---

## Overview

The objective of this task is to develop comprehensive API documentation for MeshHook, aligning with the project's commitment to ease of use, reliability, and security. The API documentation will serve as a critical resource for developers, enabling them to integrate with MeshHook effectively, understand its capabilities, and leverage its features to build and manage webhook-driven workflows with confidence.

**Purpose:** The API documentation is intended to:
- Provide clear, accurate, and detailed information about MeshHook's API endpoints, request/response formats, and error codes.
- Facilitate developers' understanding of MeshHook's functionalities, aiding in quicker integration and troubleshooting.
- Align with MeshHook's goals of delivering a user-friendly, robust, and secure webhook-first workflow engine.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

1. **Comprehensive Coverage:** Document all public API endpoints, including webhook triggers, workflow management, version publications, and run consoles.
2. **Clarity and Accuracy:** Ensure that the documentation is clear, accurate, and provides examples for common use cases.
3. **Searchability and Navigation:** The documentation should be easy to navigate, with a search function to quickly locate relevant sections or endpoints.
4. **Versioning and Updates:** Include documentation versioning, ensuring users can access documentation for previous API versions.

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** Documentation should be hosted on a platform that ensures high availability and quick load times.
- **Maintainability:** The documentation process should include a workflow for keeping it up to date with API changes.
- **Security:** Include security best practices, highlighting how to securely use the API, manage secrets, and verify webhooks.

## Technical Specifications

### Architecture Context

MeshHook's architecture, as outlined in `docs/Architecture.md`, integrates SvelteKit for SSR/API, utilizes Supabase for backend services, and employs workers for orchestration and HTTP execution. The API documentation task should consider these components and provide guidance on interacting with each through the API.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Tool Selection:** Choose a documentation tool or platform (e.g., Swagger, OpenAPI) that supports automatic generation, versioning, and hosting of API documentation.
2. **Template Creation:** Define a documentation template that includes sections for endpoint descriptions, request/response examples, error codes, and security considerations.
3. **Content Development:** Populate the template with details of all public API endpoints, adhering to MeshHook's coding and API design standards.
4. **Review and Feedback:** Conduct internal reviews of the documentation with the development team and select beta users for external feedback.
5. **Publication:** Host the finalized API documentation on a suitable platform, ensuring it is accessible to all intended users.
6. **Maintenance Plan:** Establish a process for regularly updating the documentation in line with API changes, including versioning for backward compatibility.

### Data Model and API Endpoints

No new data model changes are required for this task. However, the API documentation will detail existing endpoints, such as:

- **Webhook Triggers:** `/api/webhook/{project_id}/{workflow_id}`
- **Workflow Management:** `/api/workflows/{project_id}`
- **Version Publication:** `/api/workflows/{project_id}/{workflow_id}/versions`
- **Run Console:** `/api/runs/{run_id}`

Each endpoint section will include method, path, request parameters, request body examples, response body examples, and possible error codes.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] All public API endpoints are documented, including request/response formats and examples.
- [ ] Documentation includes a section on security best practices and webhook verification.
- [ ] The documentation is hosted on a platform that ensures easy access and navigation.
- [ ] The documentation has been reviewed internally and by selected external users for clarity and completeness.
- [ ] A maintenance plan for the documentation is established and documented.

## Dependencies and Prerequisites

- Access to the current API codebase and developers for information gathering.
- Selection and setup of the documentation tool or platform.
- Coordination with the security team to include correct security practices and webhook verification methods.

## Implementation Notes

### Development Guidelines

- Follow OpenAPI specifications for structuring API documentation.
- Ensure examples are realistic and cover typical use cases.
- Use clear and concise language to explain complex concepts.

### Testing Strategy

- Validate all documentation examples with actual API calls to ensure accuracy.
- Conduct usability testing with developers not familiar with the project to identify areas of confusion or improvement.

### Security Considerations

- Emphasize authentication, authorization, and webhook verification methods.
- Clearly mark endpoints according to their required security level and permissions.

### Monitoring & Observability

- Utilize analytics on the documentation platform to track usage, popular sections, and search queries to inform continuous improvement.
