# PRD: Connection/edge drawing for MeshHook Workflow Builder

## Overview

The connection/edge drawing task is a critical component of the MeshHook project's Workflow Builder, enabling users to visually define the flow between different nodes within their workflows. This feature is pivotal for achieving the project's goal of providing a visually intuitive and simple-to-use DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) builder that does not compromise on functionality and durability. By allowing users to draw connections or edges between nodes, we empower them to define complex workflows with ease, aligning with MeshHook's overarching objectives.

### Objectives:

- Enhance the visual workflow builder with intuitive connection/edge drawing capabilities.
- Ensure the feature's performance and reliability align with MeshHook's high standards.
- Maintain security and multi-tenancy principles integral to MeshHook's architecture.

## Functional Requirements

1. **Connection Drawing:** Users must be able to draw connections between nodes visually. This includes creating, deleting, and modifying connections.
2. **Intuitive Interface:** The interface for drawing connections should be intuitive, requiring minimal instruction for new users.
3. **Validation:** The system must validate connections to ensure workflow integrity (e.g., preventing cycles, ensuring compatible node connections).
4. **Visual Feedback:** Provide real-time visual feedback as users draw or edit connections, including snapping, highlighting, and path prediction.
5. **Persistence:** Connections must be saved as part of the workflow definition, ensuring they are persistent across sessions.

## Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** The connection/edge drawing functionality must be responsive, with real-time feedback and no perceptible lag.
- **Reliability:** The feature must be robust, with comprehensive error handling to prevent and recover from failures gracefully.
- **Security:** Implement consistent security practices, ensuring that user data and workflow definitions are protected.
- **Maintainability:** Code should be clean, well-documented, and easy to maintain, adhering to project standards.

## Technical Specifications

### Architecture Context

- **Frontend:** SvelteKit/Svelte 5, leveraging its reactivity and component architecture for a responsive UI.
- **Backend:** Supabase for persistence, including storing the workflow definitions and connection data.
- **Integration Points:** This feature must integrate seamlessly with the existing workflow builder components, including node definitions and the execution engine.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Design Mockups:** Start with detailed UI/UX designs for the connection drawing interface.
2. **UI Component Development:** Develop reusable Svelte components for drawing and managing connections.
3. **State Management:** Implement a robust state management solution to track the current state of connections and facilitate undo/redo capabilities.
4. **Backend Integration:** Define and implement the API endpoints and/or database schema changes required to persist connection data.
5. **Testing and Iteration:** Conduct thorough testing, including user acceptance testing (UAT), to ensure the feature meets all requirements.

### Data Model

- **Connections Table:** A new table may be required to store connection data, including source node, target node, and any metadata related to the connection.

### API Endpoints

- **GET /connections:** Retrieve all connections for a given workflow.
- **POST /connections:** Create a new connection.
- **DELETE /connections/{id}:** Delete a specific connection.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Users can visually draw connections between nodes within the workflow builder.
- [ ] Connections are validated in real-time to ensure workflow integrity.
- [ ] All user actions are responsive, with no perceptible lag.
- [ ] Connection data is persisted correctly and is retrievable across sessions.
- [ ] The feature integrates seamlessly with existing workflow builder components.
- [ ] Comprehensive test coverage is achieved, including unit, integration, and E2E tests.

## Dependencies

- SvelteKit and Supabase environments are correctly set up and configured.
- Existing workflow builder components and infrastructure.

## Implementation Notes

### Development Guidelines

- Follow the SvelteKit and Svelte 5 conventions for reactive UI development.
- Use ESLint and Prettier for code formatting and standardization.
- Implement TDD (Test-Driven Development) to ensure quality and reliability.

### Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests:** For individual components and utility functions.
- **Integration Tests:** To ensure components interact correctly.
- **E2E Tests:** To validate the entire feature within the context of the application.

### Security Considerations

- Validate and sanitize all user input to prevent XSS attacks.
- Ensure API endpoints are protected against unauthorized access.

### Monitoring & Observability

- Implement logging for key actions and errors.
- Monitor performance metrics to identify and address potential bottlenecks.
