# PRD: Health Check Endpoints

## Overview

<<<<<<< HEAD
The objective of this task is to implement health check endpoints for the MeshHook project. These endpoints are critical for monitoring the operational status of the application, ensuring that all components (webhook triggers, visual DAG builder, event sourcing, live logs, and multi-tenant security) are functioning as expected. This aligns with MeshHookâ€™s goal of offering a reliable and durable workflow engine by providing a means to verify system health, which is essential for production readiness.
=======
The introduction of health check endpoints is a critical enhancement for MeshHook, targeting improved operational visibility and reliability in production environments. This task aligns with MeshHook's commitment to providing a robust, Postgres-native workflow engine that combines the visual simplicity of n8n with the durability of Temporal, all while maintaining an open licensing model. Implementing health check endpoints will ensure that MeshHook's services are continuously monitored for availability, performance, and security, facilitating prompt detection and resolution of issues.

## Objectives

- Integrate health check endpoints to monitor the operational status of MeshHook's services.
- Ensure these endpoints are lightweight, secure, and minimally impactful on performance.
- Align the implementation with MeshHook's core goals, including multi-tenant security and live log updates via Supabase Realtime.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

<<<<<<< HEAD
1. **Endpoint Implementation:** Implement a `/health` API endpoint that returns the status of the application and its components.
2. **Component Status Checks:** Include checks for critical components such as the database (Postgres), external services (Supabase), and worker processes.
3. **Response Structure:** The endpoint must return a JSON response that includes the overall application status and the status of individual components.
4. **Version Information:** The health check response should also include version information for troubleshooting purposes.

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** The health check endpoint must respond within 200ms to avoid impacting service monitoring tools.
- **Reliability:** The endpoint should accurately reflect the operational status, allowing for quick detection and resolution of issues.
- **Security:** Access to the health check endpoint can be unauthenticated to allow for simple monitoring, but it must not expose sensitive information about the system's internals.
- **Maintainability:** Code related to health checks should be modular and easy to update as new components are added to the system.
=======
1. **Health Check Endpoints**: Implement RESTful API endpoints to report the health status of critical MeshHook components, including the webhook intake, workflow engine, and external dependencies like Supabase and Postgres.
2. **Health Status Schema**: Define a clear, standardized response schema for health check responses, including service name, status (healthy/unhealthy), and any relevant error messages or codes.
3. **Authentication**: Ensure these endpoints are secure, accessible only to authenticated users or systems with appropriate permissions.

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance**: Ensure health checks are lightweight and do not significantly impact the overall performance of the system.
- **Reliability**: Achieve 99.9% uptime for the health check endpoints.
- **Security**: Protect endpoints against unauthorized access and ensure they do not expose sensitive information about the system's internal state or configuration.

## Technical Specifications

### Architecture Context

<<<<<<< HEAD
MeshHook utilizes a combination of SvelteKit for its front end and workflow management, Supabase for backend services including Postgres, Realtime, and Storage, and worker processes for orchestration and execution. The health check endpoint needs to integrate seamlessly into this architecture, providing insights into the health of these components.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Analysis:** Review the current infrastructure and identify critical components whose status should be monitored.
2. **Design:** Outline the response format for the health check endpoint, including a plan for checking the status of each component.
3. **Implementation:** Develop the health check endpoint, incorporating status checks for each identified component.
   - For the database, perform a simple query to ensure it's operational.
   - For external services like Supabase, utilize their health check APIs or equivalent.
   - For worker processes, implement a mechanism to report their status, possibly through heartbeats or job completion rates.
4. **Integration:** Add the endpoint to the existing API routes, ensuring it's accessible without authentication.
5. **Testing:** Write unit and integration tests to verify the endpoint's functionality and the accuracy of component status checks.
6. **Documentation:** Update the API documentation to include the health check endpoint, its request format, and its response structure.

### Data Model

No changes to the data model are required for this task.

### API Endpoints

#### Endpoint: `GET /health`
=======
MeshHook utilizes a combination of SvelteKit for its SSR/API layer, Supabase for database and realtime functionalities, and a worker-based architecture for orchestration and HTTP execution. Health check endpoints should integrate seamlessly into this architecture, providing a real-time overview of the system's health without introducing significant load or complexity.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Analysis**: Review the current MeshHook architecture to identify critical components and dependencies that require health monitoring.
2. **Design**:
   - Design a health check API schema that includes endpoint paths, request parameters (if any), and response formats.
   - Plan the integration of health check logic into the existing SvelteKit API layer.
3. **Implementation**:
   - Develop the health check endpoints following the RESTful standards adopted by MeshHook.
   - Implement logic to assess the health of critical components, including database connectivity, external dependencies' availability, and internal service status.
   - Ensure authentication mechanisms are in place to secure these endpoints.
4. **Testing**: Write and execute unit and integration tests to validate the functionality and security of the health check endpoints.
5. **Documentation**: Update the project's API documentation to include details about the new health check endpoints.

### Data Model

No changes to the data model are required for the implementation of health check endpoints.

### API Endpoints

#### Endpoint: `GET /api/health`

## Implementation Notes

### Development Guidelines

<<<<<<< HEAD
- Follow the existing code style and conventions of the MeshHook project.
- Use asynchronous operations where possible to enhance performance.
- Ensure that new code is well-commented and documented.

### Testing Strategy

- Implement unit tests for individual component checks.
- Develop integration tests that simulate various states of the system (healthy, degraded, and unhealthy) to ensure the endpoint responds correctly.

### Security Considerations

- While the endpoint is unauthenticated, ensure it does not reveal sensitive information about the system configuration or expose any vulnerabilities.

### Monitoring & Observability

- Monitor the response time and error rate of the health check endpoint using existing observability tools.
- Consider creating alerts based on the endpoint's response to quickly identify and address system health issues.

## Related Documentation

- [Main PRD](../PRD.md)
- [Architecture](../Architecture.md)
- [Security Guidelines](../Security.md)
- [Operations Guide](../Operations.md)
=======
- Follow MeshHook's existing coding conventions and folder structure for API implementations.
- Use asynchronous patterns where applicable to avoid blocking operations during health checks.

### Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests**: For each component checked by the health endpoints, mock failures and verify responses.
- **Integration Tests**: Test the endpoint in a deployed environment with actual service dependencies to ensure accurate health reporting.

### Security Considerations

- Implement rate limiting on the health check endpoint to prevent abuse.
- Ensure that the health check responses do not leak sensitive information about the system's internal configuration or state.

### Monitoring & Observability

- Integrate endpoint metrics (response time, status codes) into MeshHook's existing monitoring tools.
- Set up alerts based on the health endpoint responses, especially for critical components reporting unhealthy status.
