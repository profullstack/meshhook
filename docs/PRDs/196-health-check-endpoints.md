# PRD: Health Check Endpoints

**Issue:** [#196](https://github.com/profullstack/meshhook/issues/196)  
**Milestone:** Phase 9: Deployment & Operations  
**Labels:** production-readiness, hacktoberfest  
**Phase:** Phase 9  
**Section:** Production Readiness  

---

## Overview

The objective of this task is to implement health check endpoints for the MeshHook project. These endpoints are critical for monitoring the operational status of the application, ensuring that all components (webhook triggers, visual DAG builder, event sourcing, live logs, and multi-tenant security) are functioning as expected. This aligns with MeshHookâ€™s goal of offering a reliable and durable workflow engine by providing a means to verify system health, which is essential for production readiness.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

1. **Endpoint Implementation:** Implement a `/health` API endpoint that returns the status of the application and its components.
2. **Component Status Checks:** Include checks for critical components such as the database (Postgres), external services (Supabase), and worker processes.
3. **Response Structure:** The endpoint must return a JSON response that includes the overall application status and the status of individual components.
4. **Version Information:** The health check response should also include version information for troubleshooting purposes.

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** The health check endpoint must respond within 200ms to avoid impacting service monitoring tools.
- **Reliability:** The endpoint should accurately reflect the operational status, allowing for quick detection and resolution of issues.
- **Security:** Access to the health check endpoint can be unauthenticated to allow for simple monitoring, but it must not expose sensitive information about the system's internals.
- **Maintainability:** Code related to health checks should be modular and easy to update as new components are added to the system.

## Technical Specifications

### Architecture Context

MeshHook utilizes a combination of SvelteKit for its front end and workflow management, Supabase for backend services including Postgres, Realtime, and Storage, and worker processes for orchestration and execution. The health check endpoint needs to integrate seamlessly into this architecture, providing insights into the health of these components.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Analysis:** Review the current infrastructure and identify critical components whose status should be monitored.
2. **Design:** Outline the response format for the health check endpoint, including a plan for checking the status of each component.
3. **Implementation:** Develop the health check endpoint, incorporating status checks for each identified component.
   - For the database, perform a simple query to ensure it's operational.
   - For external services like Supabase, utilize their health check APIs or equivalent.
   - For worker processes, implement a mechanism to report their status, possibly through heartbeats or job completion rates.
4. **Integration:** Add the endpoint to the existing API routes, ensuring it's accessible without authentication.
5. **Testing:** Write unit and integration tests to verify the endpoint's functionality and the accuracy of component status checks.
6. **Documentation:** Update the API documentation to include the health check endpoint, its request format, and its response structure.

### Data Model

No changes to the data model are required for this task.

### API Endpoints

#### Endpoint: `GET /health`

**Response:**
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "details": {
    "database": "healthy",
    "supabase": "healthy",
    "workers": "healthy"
  }
}
```

**Error Responses:**
- 500: Internal Server Error - If any critical component is not healthy

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Health check endpoint implemented and accessible via `GET /health`.
- [ ] Endpoint returns the operational status of the application and its critical components.
- [ ] Performance requirement of sub-200ms response time is met.
- [ ] Unit and integration tests verify the functionality and reliability of the endpoint.
- [ ] Documentation is updated to include details of the new endpoint.

## Dependencies

### Technical Dependencies

- Access to the project's existing API and infrastructure for integration.
- Documentation tools for updating API documentation.
- Testing frameworks and tools for unit and integration testing.

### Prerequisite Tasks

- Ensure that all critical components have a way to report their health status, adjusting as necessary to provide accurate monitoring.

## Implementation Notes

### Development Guidelines

- Follow the existing code style and conventions of the MeshHook project.
- Use asynchronous operations where possible to enhance performance.
- Ensure that new code is well-commented and documented.

### Testing Strategy

- Implement unit tests for individual component checks.
- Develop integration tests that simulate various states of the system (healthy, degraded, and unhealthy) to ensure the endpoint responds correctly.

### Security Considerations

- While the endpoint is unauthenticated, ensure it does not reveal sensitive information about the system configuration or expose any vulnerabilities.

### Monitoring & Observability

- Monitor the response time and error rate of the health check endpoint using existing observability tools.
- Consider creating alerts based on the endpoint's response to quickly identify and address system health issues.
