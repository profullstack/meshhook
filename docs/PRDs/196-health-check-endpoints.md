# PRD: Health Check Endpoints

## Overview

The introduction of health check endpoints is a critical enhancement for MeshHook, targeting improved operational visibility and reliability in production environments. This task aligns with MeshHook's commitment to providing a robust, Postgres-native workflow engine that combines the visual simplicity of n8n with the durability of Temporal, all while maintaining an open licensing model. Implementing health check endpoints will ensure that MeshHook's services are continuously monitored for availability, performance, and security, facilitating prompt detection and resolution of issues.

## Objectives

- Integrate health check endpoints to monitor the operational status of MeshHook's services.
- Ensure these endpoints are lightweight, secure, and minimally impactful on performance.
- Align the implementation with MeshHook's core goals, including multi-tenant security and live log updates via Supabase Realtime.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

1. **Health Check Endpoints**: Implement RESTful API endpoints to report the health status of critical MeshHook components, including the webhook intake, workflow engine, and external dependencies like Supabase and Postgres.
2. **Health Status Schema**: Define a clear, standardized response schema for health check responses, including service name, status (healthy/unhealthy), and any relevant error messages or codes.
3. **Authentication**: Ensure these endpoints are secure, accessible only to authenticated users or systems with appropriate permissions.

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance**: Ensure health checks are lightweight and do not significantly impact the overall performance of the system.
- **Reliability**: Achieve 99.9% uptime for the health check endpoints.
- **Security**: Protect endpoints against unauthorized access and ensure they do not expose sensitive information about the system's internal state or configuration.

## Technical Specifications

### Architecture Context

MeshHook utilizes a combination of SvelteKit for its SSR/API layer, Supabase for database and realtime functionalities, and a worker-based architecture for orchestration and HTTP execution. Health check endpoints should integrate seamlessly into this architecture, providing a real-time overview of the system's health without introducing significant load or complexity.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Analysis**: Review the current MeshHook architecture to identify critical components and dependencies that require health monitoring.
2. **Design**:
   - Design a health check API schema that includes endpoint paths, request parameters (if any), and response formats.
   - Plan the integration of health check logic into the existing SvelteKit API layer.
3. **Implementation**:
   - Develop the health check endpoints following the RESTful standards adopted by MeshHook.
   - Implement logic to assess the health of critical components, including database connectivity, external dependencies' availability, and internal service status.
   - Ensure authentication mechanisms are in place to secure these endpoints.
4. **Testing**: Write and execute unit and integration tests to validate the functionality and security of the health check endpoints.
5. **Documentation**: Update the project's API documentation to include details about the new health check endpoints.

### Data Model

No changes to the data model are required for the implementation of health check endpoints.

### API Endpoints

#### Endpoint: `GET /api/health`

**Response:**
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "components": [
    {
      "name": "Database",
      "status": "healthy"
    },
    {
      "name": "Supabase Realtime",
      "status": "healthy"
    },
    {
      "name": "Workflow Engine",
      "status": "unhealthy",
      "error": "Scheduler not responding"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Error Responses:**
- 401: Unauthorized - Authentication required
- 500: Internal Server Error - Server error or cannot connect to critical service

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Health check endpoints are implemented and return the correct status of all critical MeshHook components.
- [ ] Endpoints are secured and do not expose sensitive information.
- [ ] All new code is covered by unit and integration tests, ensuring error cases and success cases are handled correctly.
- [ ] Documentation is updated to include information about the health check endpoints.
- [ ] The implementation follows MeshHook's coding standards and best practices.

## Dependencies

### Technical Dependencies

- Access to MeshHook's existing SvelteKit setup for API endpoint integration.
- Knowledge of Supabase and Postgres for database health checks.
- Authentication mechanisms currently used by MeshHook.

### Prerequisite Tasks

- Ensure all team members have access to the latest MeshHook codebase and documentation.
- Review existing authentication patterns for securing new endpoints.

## Implementation Notes

### Development Guidelines

- Follow MeshHook's existing coding conventions and folder structure for API implementations.
- Use asynchronous patterns where applicable to avoid blocking operations during health checks.

### Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests**: For each component checked by the health endpoints, mock failures and verify responses.
- **Integration Tests**: Test the endpoint in a deployed environment with actual service dependencies to ensure accurate health reporting.

### Security Considerations

- Implement rate limiting on the health check endpoint to prevent abuse.
- Ensure that the health check responses do not leak sensitive information about the system's internal configuration or state.

### Monitoring & Observability

- Integrate endpoint metrics (response time, status codes) into MeshHook's existing monitoring tools.
- Set up alerts based on the health endpoint responses, especially for critical components reporting unhealthy status.
