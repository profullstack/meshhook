# PRD: Workflow Validation

**Issue:** [#124](https://github.com/profullstack/meshhook/issues/124)  
**Milestone:** Phase 3: Frontend (SvelteKit)  
**Labels:** workflow-builder, hacktoberfest  
**Phase:** Phase 3  
**Section:** Workflow Builder

---

## Overview

Workflow validation is a critical feature in the MeshHook project, ensuring that workflows created by users are syntactically and semantically correct before being saved and executed. This feature aligns with MeshHook's goal of providing a reliable, efficient, and secure environment for running webhook-based workflows. By validating workflows, we aim to reduce runtime errors, improve user experience, and maintain the integrity of the workflow execution environment.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

1. **Syntax Validation:** Ensure the workflow JSON structure adheres to the defined schema.
2. **Semantic Validation:** Verify that the workflow logic, such as node dependencies and paths, is consistent and logical.
3. **Node Configuration Validation:** Each node's configuration should be validated against its type-specific schema.
4. **DAG Validation:** Check for cycles, orphan nodes, and unreachable nodes within the workflow's Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).
5. **Error Reporting:** Provide detailed error messages to the user, indicating both the location and nature of the validation issue.
6. **API Documentation:** Document the validation logic and rules within the project's API documentation for clarity and transparency.

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** The validation process should not significantly impact the user's experience, aiming for a response time within 500ms.
- **Reliability:** The validation feature should have a 99.9% uptime, ensuring workflows can always be validated when needed.
- **Security:** Validation should not introduce any security vulnerabilities, such as injection attacks or unauthorized data exposure.
- **Maintainability:** The validation logic should be modular, well-documented, and easy to update or extend as the workflow features evolve.

## Technical Specifications

### Architecture Context

MeshHook leverages a SvelteKit frontend for the workflow builder, with backend components including Supabase for database and real-time updates, and serverless workers for task execution. Workflow validation will primarily be an addition to the SvelteKit frontend, with potential backend support for complex validations that cannot be efficiently performed client-side.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Design Schema:** Define JSON schemas for workflow structure, node configurations, and DAG properties.
2. **Implement Validation Functions:** Create validation functions that use the schemas to check workflows for errors.
3. **Integrate with UI:** Hook the validation logic into the workflow editor, triggering validation on save attempts and as part of the workflow editing process.
4. **User Feedback:** Implement UI components to display validation errors, highlighting the problematic areas in the workflow editor.
5. **Testing:** Write unit and integration tests for the validation logic, ensuring comprehensive coverage.
6. **Documentation:** Update the project documentation to explain the validation process, including any limitations or known issues.

### Data Model

No changes to the data model are required specifically for workflow validation. However, updates to the workflow schema definitions will be needed to support validation.

### API Endpoints

No new API endpoints are required for this task. Existing endpoints for workflow creation and update will be utilized.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Workflow syntax and semantics are validated according to project specifications.
- [ ] Validation errors are clearly communicated to the user, with guidance on how to resolve them.
- [ ] Validation does not significantly degrade the user experience or performance.
- [ ] All new code is covered by automated tests (unit and integration where applicable).
- [ ] Documentation is updated to reflect the validation process and rules.
- [ ] Security review completed with no major issues identified.

## Dependencies

- JSON Schema validator library compatible with SvelteKit.
- Existing workflow schema definitions.

### Prerequisite Tasks

- Review and update workflow schema definitions.
- Ensure the SvelteKit environment is configured for the new validation logic.

## Implementation Notes

### Development Guidelines

1. Use async validation patterns to avoid blocking the UI thread.
2. Modularize validation logic for maintainability and testability.
3. Adhere to existing coding standards for consistency.

### Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests:** For individual validation functions.
- **Integration Tests:** For the integration of the validation system with the workflow editor.
- **Manual Testing:** To ensure the UI properly displays validation errors and guides the user.

### Security Considerations

- Validate input to avoid injection vulnerabilities.
- Ensure that error messages do not expose sensitive information about the workflow structure or contents.

### Monitoring & Observability

- Log validation error trends to identify common user challenges or potential improvements to the validation logic.
