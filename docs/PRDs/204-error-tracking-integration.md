## Technical Specifications

### Architecture Context

<<<<<<< HEAD
MeshHook utilizes SvelteKit for frontend and backend operations, with Supabase providing backend services. The error tracking integration requires hooks into the SvelteKit application layer for frontend errors and potentially direct integration with backend services (Node.js) and workers for backend errors.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Service Selection:** Choose an error tracking service and setup a project account.
2. **Backend Integration:**
   - Integrate the chosen service's SDK with MeshHook's backend.
   - Initialize the error tracking client at application startup.
   - Implement global error handling to capture and report uncaught exceptions and rejections.
3. **Frontend Integration:**
   - Integrate the SDK into the SvelteKit frontend.
   - Initialize the client and configure error capturing.
4. **Configuration:** Implement and document configuration settings for enabling and setting up the error tracking service.
5. **Documentation:** Update the project's documentation to include setup and usage instructions for the error tracking integration.

### Data Model Changes

None required for the integration itself. However, storing configuration settings might be considered separately.

### API Endpoints
