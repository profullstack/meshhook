# PRD: Error Tracking Integration for MeshHook

## Overview

As MeshHook evolves, ensuring the stability and reliability of both its frontend and backend components becomes increasingly crucial. The integration of an error tracking solution is aimed at significantly enhancing MeshHook's operational reliability by providing real-time insights into runtime errors. This initiative is directly aligned with our commitment to deliver a robust, webhook-first, deterministic, Postgres-native workflow engine.

### Purpose

The primary objectives of integrating an error tracking system into MeshHook are:
- To automate the detection and reporting of errors, enabling quick identification and resolution of issues.
- To enhance the overall system stability and user experience by minimizing downtime and error occurrences.
- To streamline the debugging process with detailed error reports, including contextual information for faster issue resolution.

### Alignment with Project Goals

This integration supports MeshHook's foundational goals by:
- Increasing the reliability and stability of webhook triggers and execution engine operations.
- Enhancing the user experience with the visual DAG builder by ensuring a more stable frontend.
- Contributing to the durability of workflow runs with improved error detection and handling.
- Ensuring the accuracy and reliability of live logs through real-time error reporting.
- Maintaining a secure, multi-tenant environment with robust error management and reporting capabilities.

## Functional Requirements

1. **Error Tracking Service Integration**: MeshHook shall integrate with an established error tracking service, such as Sentry or Rollbar, to provide comprehensive error monitoring capabilities.
2. **Automatic Error Capture and Reporting**: The system must automatically capture and report runtime errors from both the backend (Node.js) and frontend (SvelteKit) environments.
3. **Contextual Error Information**: Reported errors must include detailed context, such as workflow ID, execution step, user ID (where applicable), and any pertinent data to facilitate rapid diagnosis and resolution.
4. **Configurability**: Administrators should be able to easily configure the error tracking integration, including enabling or disabling the feature and setting service-specific parameters like DSN or API keys, via environment variables or configuration files.
5. **Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation must be provided, detailing the configuration and use of the error tracking integration within MeshHook.

## Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance**: The integration must have a minimal impact on MeshHook's performance, ensuring that the engine's responsiveness and efficiency are not adversely affected.
- **Security**: All data transmitted to the error tracking service must be handled securely, with sensitive information being appropriately redacted or encrypted.
- **Reliability**: The error tracking integration must function consistently across all supported environments and configurations, ensuring reliable error capture and reporting.
- **Maintainability**: The implementation should adhere to MeshHook's coding standards, be well-documented, easy to maintain, and facilitate future enhancements or integrations.

## Technical Specifications

### Architecture Context

MeshHook leverages SvelteKit for both frontend and backend operations, and integrates with Supabase for backend services. The error tracking integration necessitates hooks into the SvelteKit application layer to capture frontend errors, and direct integration with backend services (Node.js) and workers for capturing backend errors.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Service Selection**: Choose a suitable error tracking service and set up a project account.
2. **Backend Integration**:
   - Integrate the chosen service's SDK into MeshHook's backend.
   - Initialize the error tracking client upon application startup.
   - Implement global error handlers to capture and report uncaught exceptions and rejections.
3. **Frontend Integration**:
   - Integrate the error tracking SDK into MeshHook's SvelteKit frontend.
   - Configure the client to initialize and capture errors effectively.
4. **Configuration**: Develop and document the configuration process for the error tracking service, including environment variables or configuration files.
5. **Documentation**: Update MeshHook's documentation to include instructions for setting up and managing the error tracking integration.

### Data Model Changes

No changes to the data model are required for the integration itself. Configuration settings for the error tracking service may be managed externally or within existing configuration management structures.

### API Endpoints

Not applicable for this integration.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Successful integration with an error tracking service is demonstrated by the capture and reporting of both backend and frontend errors.
- [ ] All error reports include detailed contextual information.
- [ ] The performance impact of the integration is minimal, as verified by benchmarks.
- [ ] Configuration settings for the error tracking service are implemented and documented.
- [ ] Comprehensive documentation on setting up and managing the error tracking integration is provided.
- [ ] The handling of sensitive information in error reports meets MeshHook's security standards.

## Dependencies

- Access to an error tracking service (e.g., Sentry, Rollbar) is required, including necessary accounts and permissions.

## Implementation Notes

### Development Guidelines

- Adhere to async/await patterns for asynchronous operations.
- Ensure that any third-party SDKs or libraries are up to date.
- Follow MeshHook's established project structure and coding standards for integrating new services or utilities.

### Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests**: Develop unit tests for new utility functions or configuration loaders.
- **Integration Tests**: Conduct integration tests to ensure errors are accurately captured and reported.
- **Manual Testing**: Perform manual testing to confirm that error reports contain the correct contextual information.

### Security Considerations

- Follow best practices for secure integration as recommended by the error tracking service.
- Securely manage API keys or DSNs, ensuring they are not exposed in the frontend or within code repositories.
- Sanitize error data to remove or redact sensitive information before transmission to the error tracking service.

### Monitoring & Observability

- Monitor the volume and types of errors reported to identify trends and potential areas for system improvement.
- Use insights from the error tracking service to prioritize bug fixes and enhancements.
