# PRD: Error Tracking Integration

**Issue:** [#204](https://github.com/profullstack/meshhook/issues/204)  
**Milestone:** Phase 9: Deployment & Operations  
**Labels:** monitoring, hacktoberfest  
**Owner:** Anthony Ettinger  
**License:** MIT  

## Overview

The purpose of this task is to integrate error tracking into MeshHook to enhance our monitoring capabilities, ensuring high reliability, and maintainability of our workflow engine. By systematically capturing and analyzing errors across MeshHook's components, we can proactively address potential issues, improve user experience, and streamline debugging processes. This integration aligns with MeshHook's objectives of delivering a robust, secure, and user-friendly workflow engine.

## Functional Requirements

1. **Integration with Error Tracking Service:** Integrate MeshHook with a leading error tracking service (e.g., Sentry, Rollbar) to automatically capture and report errors.
2. **Error Context Information:** Ensure that each reported error includes detailed context information such as timestamp, service/component, environment (development/production), and workflow execution ID if applicable.
3. **User Impact Analysis:** Ability to analyze the impact of errors on users, including affected user count and potential workflow disruptions.
4. **Notification System:** Implement a notification system to alert developers and system administrators about critical errors via email, Slack, or other communication channels.
5. **Error Tracking Dashboard:** Utilize the error tracking service's dashboard for real-time monitoring and analysis of error trends, frequency, and severity.

## Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** The error tracking integration should not significantly impact the performance of MeshHook operations. Error reporting should be asynchronous and non-blocking.
- **Reliability:** Ensure that error tracking is highly reliable, with errors being captured and reported in real-time without loss of data.
- **Security:** Sensitive information, such as user data and secrets, must be redacted from error reports to comply with privacy regulations and MeshHook's security guidelines.
- **Maintainability:** The integration should be implemented in a modular fashion, allowing for easy updates and maintenance without affecting the core functionality of MeshHook.

## Technical Specifications

### Architecture Context

- **SvelteKit (SSR/API):** for serving web content and handling API requests.
- **Supabase:** leveraging Postgres for data storage, including workflow definitions, runs, and events. Realtime is used for log streaming.
- **Workers:** Orchestrator and HTTP Executor handle workflow execution and HTTP requests, respectively.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Evaluation:** Select an error tracking service that aligns with our technical stack and project requirements.
2. **Service Integration:** Implement SDK or API integration within MeshHook's backend, specifically within the SvelteKit API and worker components.
3. **Configuration:** Configure the error tracking service to capture detailed error reports and context information. Set up environments (development/production) accordingly.
4. **Notification Setup:** Configure alerts and notifications for critical errors to ensure immediate attention.
5. **Dashboard Monitoring:** Train the team on using the error tracking dashboard for monitoring and analysis.

### Data Model

No direct changes to the data model are required for this task. However, additional logging or metadata fields may be considered for internal monitoring and troubleshooting purposes, pending further analysis during implementation.

### API Endpoints

This task does not introduce new API endpoints but will involve integrating error reporting within existing API logic and workers.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Integration with the selected error tracking service is complete and operational.
- [ ] Errors across all components of MeshHook are being captured and reported reliably.
- [ ] Error reports include detailed context information for effective debugging.
- [ ] Notification system for critical errors is operational.
- [ ] The team can utilize the error tracking dashboard for monitoring and analysis.
- [ ] No significant impact on the performance of MeshHook operations due to error tracking integration.
- [ ] All sensitive information is redacted from error reports.

## Dependencies

- Access to the selected error tracking service (e.g., Sentry, Rollbar account).
- Necessary permissions and API keys for integrating the error tracking service.

## Implementation Notes

### Development Guidelines

- Ensure that error tracking SDK/API integration is modular and easily configurable.
- Follow MeshHook's coding standards and best practices for security and performance.
- Implement thorough testing, including unit and integration tests, to validate error reporting functionality.

### Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests:** Cover the integration logic with unit tests to ensure error reporting functions as expected under various scenarios.
- **Integration Tests:** Validate the end-to-end error reporting flow, from capture to notification, within the development environment.

### Security Considerations

- Adhere to MeshHook's security guidelines, ensuring that sensitive information is redacted from error reports.
- Securely manage API keys and credentials required for the error tracking service.

### Monitoring & Observability

- Utilize the error tracking dashboard for real-time monitoring and historical analysis of errors.
- Set up alerts and notifications for proactive error management and response.
