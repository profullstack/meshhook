# PRD: Error tracking integration

**Issue:** [#204](https://github.com/profullstack/meshhook/issues/204)  
**Milestone:** Phase 9: Deployment & Operations  
**Labels:** monitoring, hacktoberfest  
**Phase:** Phase 9  
**Section:** Monitoring  

---

## Overview

The purpose of this task is to integrate error tracking capabilities into the MeshHook project. This integration is aimed at enhancing the observability and reliability of the system by providing real-time insights into errors that occur within the workflow engine. It aligns with MeshHook's core goals by ensuring high reliability and maintainability of the system.

Error tracking integration will enable the team to quickly identify, diagnose, and rectify issues, thereby improving the overall user experience and system stability. This integration is a critical component of the monitoring section in Phase 9 of the project, focusing on deployment and operations.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

1. **Integration with an Error Tracking Service:** Integrate MeshHook with a leading error tracking service such as Sentry, Rollbar, or a similar platform.
2. **Error Capture and Reporting:** Automatically capture and report errors from both the backend (Node.js environment) and the frontend (SvelteKit).
3. **Error Context Information:** Ensure that each reported error includes context information such as the workflow ID, execution step, user ID (if applicable), and any other relevant data to aid in debugging.
4. **Configurability:** Provide configuration options for the error tracking integration, allowing users to enable/disable it, set DSN (Data Source Name), and configure other service-specific settings via environment variables or a configuration file.
5. **Documentation:** Update the project documentation to include instructions on how to configure the error tracking integration, including how to set up the service account, obtain the DSN, and any other necessary steps.

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** Ensure that the error tracking integration does not significantly impact the performance of the MeshHook engine, particularly in terms of response times and resource usage.
- **Security:** Securely handle all data transmitted to the error tracking service, ensuring that sensitive information is redacted or encrypted as necessary.
- **Reliability:** The integration must be reliable across all supported platforms and configurations, ensuring that errors are consistently reported and captured without loss.
- **Maintainability:** Write clean, well-documented, and testable code that adheres to the MeshHook project's coding standards and best practices.

## Technical Specifications

### Architecture Context

MeshHook's architecture is built around SvelteKit for the frontend and backend logic, with Supabase providing backend services such as Postgres, Realtime, and Storage. Error tracking integration will require hooks into both the SvelteKit application layer and potentially directly with Supabase services or the background workers, depending on where errors need to be captured.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Service Selection and Setup:** Choose an error tracking service and set up a project account to obtain the necessary DSN or API keys.
2. **Backend Integration:**
   - Install any necessary SDKs for Node.js.
   - Initialize the error tracking client during the application startup.
   - Implement global error handlers to capture unhandled exceptions and rejections.
3. **Frontend Integration:**
   - Include the error tracking SDK in the SvelteKit frontend.
   - Initialize the client and configure it to capture relevant errors and messages.
4. **Contextual Information:** Develop mechanisms to enrich error reports with context-specific data, leveraging MeshHook's existing data structures and flow context.
5. **Configuration and Documentation:** Implement configuration options and document the setup process and usage.

### Data Model Changes

No direct changes to the data model are required for this task. However, considerations for storing configuration settings related to error tracking may be addressed separately if needed.

### API Endpoints

No new API endpoints are required for this task.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Error tracking service successfully integrated with both the backend and frontend of MeshHook.
- [ ] Errors are automatically captured and reported, with adequate context information included in reports.
- [ ] Performance benchmarks post-integration indicate minimal impact on response times and system resource usage.
- [ ] Configuration options are fully implemented and documented.
- [ ] Documentation for setting up and managing the error tracking integration is complete and accurate.
- [ ] Security review confirms that sensitive information is appropriately handled in error reports.

## Dependencies

- Access to an error tracking service (e.g., Sentry, Rollbar) including necessary accounts and permissions.
- Environment setup for secure storage and access to API keys or DSNs required for the error tracking service.

## Implementation Notes

### Development Guidelines

- Utilize async/await patterns for error handling and reporting.
- Ensure all external SDKs or libraries used are up to date and maintained.
- Follow the existing project structure for adding new services or utilities.

### Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests:** Cover new utility functions or configuration loaders related to error tracking.
- **Integration Tests:** Simulate errors in both the backend and frontend to ensure they are captured and reported as expected.
- **Manual Testing:** Perform manual testing to verify that error reports contain the correct context and information.

### Security Considerations

- Review and apply the error tracking service's best practices for security.
- Ensure API keys or DSNs are stored securely and not exposed to the frontend or in code repositories.
- Implement data sanitization to remove or redact sensitive information before sending it to the error tracking service.

### Monitoring & Observability

- Monitor the volume and types of errors reported post-integration to gauge the stability and health of the system.
- Use the insights from error tracking to prioritize bug fixes and improvements in future development cycles.
