# PRD: Error Tracking Integration

## Overview

In the pursuit of enhancing MeshHook's reliability and maintainability, integrating an error tracking system is pivotal. This integration is centered on augmenting the system's observability by providing immediate insights into runtime errors across both the frontend and backend. It directly supports MeshHook's goals by ensuring high system reliabilityâ€”a critical factor for a webhook-first, deterministic, Postgres-native workflow engine like MeshHook.

### Purpose

The purpose of this integration is to:
- Automate error detection and reporting to swiftly identify, diagnose, and correct issues.
- Improve system stability and user experience by reducing downtime and error rates.
- Facilitate a more efficient debugging process through detailed error contexts.

### Alignment with Project Goals

This task aligns with MeshHook's core objectives by:
- Enhancing the reliability of the webhook triggers and the execution engine.
- Supporting the visual DAG builder by ensuring a stable frontend environment.
- Maintaining the durability of runs through improved error handling mechanisms.
- Ensuring live logs provided via Supabase Realtime are accurate and reflective of system health.
- Upholding multi-tenant RLS security by securely managing and reporting errors across tenants.

## Functional Requirements

1. **Service Integration:** MeshHook shall integrate with an external error tracking service like Sentry or Rollbar.
2. **Error Capture and Reporting:** Automatically capture and report runtime errors from both backend (Node.js) and frontend (SvelteKit) environments.
3. **Contextual Error Information:** Each error report must include context such as workflow ID, execution step, user ID (if applicable), and any relevant data.
4. **Configurability:** Administrators must be able to configure the error tracking service through environment variables or configuration files, including enabling or disabling the service and setting the DSN or API keys.
5. **Documentation:** Provide comprehensive documentation on configuring and using the error tracking integration.

## Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** The error tracking integration must incur minimal performance overhead, not impacting the engine's responsiveness or efficiency.
- **Security:** Ensure that all data transmitted to the error tracking service is handled securely, with sensitive information appropriately redacted or encrypted.
- **Reliability:** The integration must function reliably across all supported environments and configurations, ensuring consistent error capture and reporting.
- **Maintainability:** The implementation should adhere to MeshHook's coding standards, be well-documented, and easy to maintain.

## Technical Specifications

### Architecture Context

MeshHook utilizes SvelteKit for frontend and backend operations, with Supabase providing backend services. The error tracking integration requires hooks into the SvelteKit application layer for frontend errors and potentially direct integration with backend services (Node.js) and workers for backend errors.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Service Selection:** Choose an error tracking service and setup a project account.
2. **Backend Integration:**
   - Integrate the chosen service's SDK with MeshHook's backend.
   - Initialize the error tracking client at application startup.
   - Implement global error handling to capture and report uncaught exceptions and rejections.
3. **Frontend Integration:**
   - Integrate the SDK into the SvelteKit frontend.
   - Initialize the client and configure error capturing.
4. **Configuration:** Implement and document configuration settings for enabling and setting up the error tracking service.
5. **Documentation:** Update the project's documentation to include setup and usage instructions for the error tracking integration.

### Data Model Changes

None required for the integration itself. However, storing configuration settings might be considered separately.

### API Endpoints

Not applicable for this integration.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Successful integration with an error tracking service confirmed by capturing and reporting backend and frontend errors.
- [ ] Contextual information is included in all error reports.
- [ ] Minimal performance overhead confirmed by benchmarks.
- [ ] Configuration settings are implemented and documented.
- [ ] Comprehensive documentation for the error tracking setup and management is provided.
- [ ] Sensitive information is handled securely in all error reports.

## Dependencies

- Access to an error tracking service (e.g., Sentry, Rollbar).
- Necessary accounts and permissions for the chosen service.

## Implementation Notes

### Development Guidelines

- Follow async/await patterns for asynchronous operations.
- Ensure that third-party SDKs or libraries are up to date.
- Adhere to MeshHook's project structure for adding new services or utilities.

### Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests:** For new utility functions or configuration loaders.
- **Integration Tests:** To simulate errors and ensure they are captured and reported accurately.
- **Manual Testing:** To verify that error reports contain the correct context and information.

### Security Considerations

- Apply best practices from the error tracking service for secure integration.
- Securely store API keys or DSNs, ensuring they are not exposed in the frontend or code repositories.
- Sanitize data to remove or redact sensitive information before sending to the error tracking service.

### Monitoring & Observability

- Monitor the volume and types of errors reported to identify system stability and health.
- Utilize error tracking insights for prioritizing bug fixes and improvements.
