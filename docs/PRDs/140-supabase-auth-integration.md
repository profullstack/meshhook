# PRD: Supabase Auth Integration

## Overview

The integration of Supabase Auth into MeshHook represents a crucial milestone in Phase 4: Security, aligning with our authentication and authorization objectives. This task aims to leverage Supabase's robust authentication mechanisms to secure access to MeshHook, enhancing the platform's security posture and providing a seamless user experience.

MeshHook, by design, prioritizes simplicity, durability, and multi-tenancy security. The integration of Supabase Auth is a strategic move to bolster these features, ensuring that access to crucial workflow operations and sensitive data is tightly controlled and in compliance with best practices.

### Objective

Seamlessly integrate Supabase Auth to manage user authentication and authorization within the MeshHook platform.

## Functional Requirements

1. **Auth Integration:** Implement Supabase Auth for authentication and authorization, replacing any placeholder or less secure mechanisms.
2. **User Management:** Support user signup, login, logout, and profile management through Supabase Auth.
3. **Access Control:** Integrate Supabase Auth roles with MeshHook's multi-tenant RLS security model, ensuring users can only access data and operations within their scope.
4. **API Authentication:** Secure all API endpoints with Supabase Auth, requiring valid authentication tokens for access.
5. **Documentation:** Update all relevant documentation to reflect the changes in authentication mechanisms, including setup, usage, and API access.

## Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** Authentication operations must not significantly impact the application's response times, aiming for sub-second responses for authentication-related processes.
- **Security:** Utilize Supabase Auth's built-in security features, such as JWT tokens and secure password hashing, to ensure robust security for user credentials and sessions.
- **Reliability:** Achieve a 99.9% uptime for authentication services, ensuring users have consistent access.
- **Maintainability:** Follow clean code practices, ensuring the integration is maintainable and scalable.

## Technical Specifications

### Architecture Context

MeshHook utilizes a robust stack including SvelteKit for SSR/API, Supabase for backend services, and a worker-based architecture for workflow orchestration. The integration of Supabase Auth requires careful consideration of these components to ensure seamless operation:

- **SvelteKit (SSR/API):** Integration points for login, logout, and user session management.
- **Supabase:** Utilization of Supabase's Auth, Postgres, Realtime, and Storage services.
- **Workers:** Ensure worker tasks that require user context are securely authenticated.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Preparation:** Review Supabase Auth documentation and existing MeshHook authentication flow.
2. **Integration Design:** Plan the integration, focusing on user authentication flows, secure API access, and compatibility with MeshHook's RLS security model.
3. **Supabase Setup:** Configure Supabase Auth, including roles, permissions, and security rules aligned with MeshHook requirements.
4. **Code Implementation:**
   - Integrate Supabase Auth SDK with the SvelteKit frontend for user management operations.
   - Secure API endpoints using Supabase Auth JWT tokens.
   - Map Supabase Auth roles to MeshHook's RLS policies.
5. **Testing:** Implement comprehensive testing, covering unit, integration, and e2e tests for authentication flows.
6. **Deployment:** Roll out the integration in a controlled environment, monitor metrics, and gather user feedback.
7. **Documentation:** Update all documentation to reflect the new authentication system.

### Data Model

No immediate changes to the existing data model are anticipated. However, adjustments will be made as needed to align with Supabase Auth integration, particularly concerning user and roles management.

### API Endpoints

- Update existing API endpoints to require Supabase Auth token verification.
- No new endpoints are initially required; however, adjustments may be identified during the implementation phase.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Supabase Auth integration is complete, enabling user sign-up, login, and logout.
- [ ] User sessions are correctly managed across the platform, with secure token handling.
- [ ] API endpoints are secured with Supabase Auth, requiring valid tokens for access.
- [ ] MeshHook's RLS security model is integrated with Supabase Auth roles.
- [ ] Documentation is updated to reflect the new authentication mechanism.
- [ ] All new code is thoroughly tested and reviewed.

## Dependencies

- Access to Supabase project and configuration rights.
- Familiarity with the current authentication mechanism within MeshHook.
- Existing infrastructure and services (SvelteKit, Supabase, etc.) are operational.

## Implementation Notes

### Development Guidelines

- Follow the existing codebase pattern, emphasizing modular, clean, and testable code.
- Utilize environment variables for sensitive information (API keys, secrets).
- Implement error handling and logging, especially for authentication flows.

### Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests:** Focus on isolated functions and components related to authentication.
- **Integration Tests:** Cover the full authentication flow, from login to accessing secured resources.
- **E2E Tests:** Simulate user scenarios to ensure the authentication process is seamless and secure.

### Security Considerations

- Ensure all communication with Supabase Auth is over HTTPS.
- Securely handle JWT tokens to prevent leakage or unauthorized access.
- Regularly review Supabase Auth configurations for roles and permissions to align with least privilege principles.

### Monitoring & Observability

- Monitor authentication flows for failures and unexpected behaviors.
- Track login attempts, successes, and failures to identify potential security threats.
- Use Supabase Realtime for live updates and monitoring where applicable.

By following this PRD, MeshHook will successfully integrate Supabase Auth, enhancing the platform's security and user experience.
