# PRD: Implementation of Loading States (Issue #213)

## Overview

<<<<<<< HEAD
The task of implementing loading states is critical to enhancing the user experience within the MeshHook platform. This work aligns with the overarching goal of MeshHook to deliver a visually simple and durable workflow engine that is easy to use and understand. By introducing clear and informative loading indicators, we aim to maintain user engagement and minimize confusion during asynchronous operations, thereby improving the overall usability and responsiveness of the application.

### Purpose

The purpose of this task is to implement visually consistent and informative loading states across various components of the MeshHook platform, including webhook processing, workflow execution, and live log updates. This will provide immediate feedback to users during asynchronous operations, enhancing the user experience.

### Alignment with Project Goals

Implementing loading states directly supports MeshHook's goals by:
- **Enhancing Usability:** Making the application more intuitive and responsive.
- **Improving Feedback Mechanisms:** Offering immediate visual feedback during operations, which is crucial for a seamless user experience.
- **Maintaining Performance and Reliability:** Ensuring loading indicators are lightweight and do not affect the application's performance.
=======
This task focuses on enhancing the user experience within MeshHook by implementing comprehensive loading states across the application. As MeshHook aims to provide a seamless and visually intuitive workflow engine, incorporating clear loading indicators is crucial for maintaining user engagement and minimizing confusion during asynchronous operations. This implementation must be in line with MeshHookâ€™s core features, including webhook triggers, the DAG builder, and live logs, ensuring that users have immediate feedback on the system's status at any point in their interaction.

### Objectives

- Introduce visually consistent and informative loading states across the MeshHook platform.
- Enhance user experience by providing immediate feedback during asynchronous operations.
- Align loading state designs with the overall aesthetic and usability goals of MeshHook.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

<<<<<<< HEAD
1. **Loading Indicators:** Develop and implement loading indicators for:
   - Webhook intake and processing.
   - Workflow execution and status updates.
   - Fetching and displaying live logs.
2. **Visual Consistency:** Ensure that loading indicators are consistent in design, utilizing MeshHook's UI theme.
3. **Informative Feedback:** Provide users with information about the ongoing process and expected completion time, where feasible.
4. **Error Handling:** Introduce error and timeout states for operations that do not complete successfully within a predefined timeframe.

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** Ensure that the loading indicators are optimized for performance, with minimal impact on the application's responsiveness.
- **Accessibility:** Adhere to accessibility standards, ensuring that loading states are perceivable to all users.
- **Maintainability:** Design the implementation to be easily extensible for future enhancements and integrations.
=======
1. **Loading Indicators:** Implement loading indicators for all asynchronous operations, including but not limited to:
   - Webhook processing
   - Workflow execution
   - Live log updates
2. **Consistency:** Ensure that the loading indicators are consistent in design and behavior across different parts of the application.
3. **Informative:** Where possible, provide details about the operation's progress or expected wait time.
4. **Fallbacks:** Implement error states or timeout messages for cases where operations do not complete successfully or within a reasonable timeframe.

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** Loading indicators should be lightweight and not impact the overall performance of the application.
- **Accessibility:** Ensure that loading states are accessible, including proper use of ARIA roles and labels.
- **Maintainability:** Implement loading states in a manner that they can be easily reused and extended for future asynchronous operations.

## Technical Specifications

### Architecture Context

<<<<<<< HEAD
MeshHook utilizes a SvelteKit/Svelte 5 front-end and Supabase Realtime for backend operations. The loading state enhancements should integrate seamlessly with these technologies, leveraging Svelte's reactivity and Supabase's real-time capabilities without necessitating significant architectural changes.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Design:** Collaborate with the UX/UI team to design loading indicators that complement MeshHook's design language.
2. **Identify Integration Points:** Pinpoint areas within the application requiring loading states, including asynchronous data fetches and long-running operations.
3. **Component Development:** Create a reusable Svelte component for loading indicators that can be integrated across the application.
4. **Integration:** Embed the loading component within the application at identified points, ensuring activation during all relevant asynchronous operations.
5. **Testing:** Conduct comprehensive testing to guarantee that loading states function correctly and do not introduce performance bottlenecks.

### Data Model and API Endpoints

- **Data Model Changes:** None required for the implementation of loading states.
- **API Endpoints:** No new endpoints are needed. However, ensure existing endpoints are optimized for performance to reduce loading times.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Loading indicators are visible during all major asynchronous operations.
- [ ] The design and behavior of loading states are consistent across the application.
- [ ] Performance metrics before and after implementation show no significant degradation.
- [ ] All loading states meet accessibility standards.
- [ ] Error and timeout states provide clear, informative feedback to the user.
=======
MeshHook utilizes SvelteKit for its front-end and interacts with Supabase for real-time data updates. The loading state implementation should seamlessly integrate with these existing technologies without requiring significant architectural changes.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Design:** Collaborate with the UX/UI team to design loading indicators that fit within MeshHook's design system.
2. **Integration Points Identification:** Identify all areas within the application where asynchronous operations occur that would require a loading state.
3. **Component Development:** Develop a reusable loading component using Svelte that can be integrated across the application.
4. **Integration:** Integrate the loading component into the application, ensuring it is triggered during all identified asynchronous operations.
5. **Testing:** Perform thorough testing to ensure loading states appear as expected and do not introduce performance issues.

### Data Model

No changes to the data model are required for this task.

### API Endpoints

No new API endpoints are required for this task.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Loading indicators are implemented for all identified asynchronous operations.
- [ ] Loading states are consistent in design and behavior across the application.
- [ ] Loading indicators do not adversely affect application performance.
- [ ] Accessibility standards are met for all loading states.
- [ ] Error and timeout states are handled gracefully, providing clear feedback to the user.
