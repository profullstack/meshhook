# PRD: Loading States

**Issue:** [#213](https://github.com/profullstack/meshhook/issues/213)  
**Milestone:** Phase 10: Polish & Launch  
**Labels:** ux-improvements, hacktoberfest  
**Phase:** Phase 10  
**Section:** UX Improvements

## Overview

This task focuses on enhancing the user experience within MeshHook by implementing comprehensive loading states across the application. As MeshHook aims to provide a seamless and visually intuitive workflow engine, incorporating clear loading indicators is crucial for maintaining user engagement and minimizing confusion during asynchronous operations. This implementation must be in line with MeshHookâ€™s core features, including webhook triggers, the DAG builder, and live logs, ensuring that users have immediate feedback on the system's status at any point in their interaction.

### Objectives

- Introduce visually consistent and informative loading states across the MeshHook platform.
- Enhance user experience by providing immediate feedback during asynchronous operations.
- Align loading state designs with the overall aesthetic and usability goals of MeshHook.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

1. **Loading Indicators:** Implement loading indicators for all asynchronous operations, including but not limited to:
   - Webhook processing
   - Workflow execution
   - Live log updates
2. **Consistency:** Ensure that the loading indicators are consistent in design and behavior across different parts of the application.
3. **Informative:** Where possible, provide details about the operation's progress or expected wait time.
4. **Fallbacks:** Implement error states or timeout messages for cases where operations do not complete successfully or within a reasonable timeframe.

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** Loading indicators should be lightweight and not impact the overall performance of the application.
- **Accessibility:** Ensure that loading states are accessible, including proper use of ARIA roles and labels.
- **Maintainability:** Implement loading states in a manner that they can be easily reused and extended for future asynchronous operations.

## Technical Specifications

### Architecture Context

MeshHook utilizes SvelteKit for its front-end and interacts with Supabase for real-time data updates. The loading state implementation should seamlessly integrate with these existing technologies without requiring significant architectural changes.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Design:** Collaborate with the UX/UI team to design loading indicators that fit within MeshHook's design system.
2. **Integration Points Identification:** Identify all areas within the application where asynchronous operations occur that would require a loading state.
3. **Component Development:** Develop a reusable loading component using Svelte that can be integrated across the application.
4. **Integration:** Integrate the loading component into the application, ensuring it is triggered during all identified asynchronous operations.
5. **Testing:** Perform thorough testing to ensure loading states appear as expected and do not introduce performance issues.

### Data Model

No changes to the data model are required for this task.

### API Endpoints

No new API endpoints are required for this task.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Loading indicators are implemented for all identified asynchronous operations.
- [ ] Loading states are consistent in design and behavior across the application.
- [ ] Loading indicators do not adversely affect application performance.
- [ ] Accessibility standards are met for all loading states.
- [ ] Error and timeout states are handled gracefully, providing clear feedback to the user.

## Dependencies

### Technical Dependencies

- SvelteKit for front-end development.
- Supabase Realtime for live data updates.

### Prerequisite Tasks

- UX/UI design for loading indicators must be completed and approved.

## Implementation Notes

### Development Guidelines

- Follow the SvelteKit development patterns established in the MeshHook codebase.
- Ensure that all loading states are implemented as reusable components.
- Adhere to accessibility guidelines for web content (WCAG).

### Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests:** Test the loading component in isolation to ensure it functions correctly.
- **Integration Tests:** Test the integration of the loading component within various parts of the application.
- **Manual Testing:** Manually test the application to ensure loading states appear as expected and provide useful feedback.

### Security Considerations

No specific security considerations for this task.

### Monitoring & Observability

- Monitor application performance metrics to ensure loading states do not introduce performance regressions.
- Utilize browser developer tools and SvelteKit debugging features to troubleshoot any issues during development.
