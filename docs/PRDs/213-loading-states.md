# PRD: Implementing Loading States

**Issue:** [#213](https://github.com/profullstack/meshhook/issues/213)  
**Milestone:** Phase 10: Polish & Launch  
**Labels:** ux-improvements, hacktoberfest  
**Phase:** Phase 10  
**Section:** UX Improvements  

---

## Overview

The purpose of this task is to enhance the user experience of MeshHook by implementing intuitive and informative loading states across the platform. This initiative aligns with our project goals of delivering a visually simple and durable workflow engine by ensuring users are kept informed about the system status during operations, thereby improving overall usability and satisfaction.

**Objective:** Implement loading states to provide feedback to users during all asynchronous operations.

This task supports MeshHook's core features by improving the user interface's responsiveness and transparency during operations such as webhook triggers, DAG building, and live log streaming.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

1. **Loading Indicators:** Implement loading indicators for all asynchronous operations including but not limited to:
   - Webhook triggers processing.
   - DAG builder loading and operations.
   - Live log updates.
2. **Feedback Mechanism:** Provide immediate visual feedback when an operation is initiated.
3. **Error States:** Implement error states for failed operations with an option for users to retry the operation if applicable.

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** Ensure loading states do not negatively impact the overall performance of the application.
- **Accessibility:** Loading indicators must be accessible, providing textual descriptions for screen readers.
- **Consistency:** Loading states should be consistent in design and behavior across the application.

## Technical Specifications

### Architecture Context

MeshHook utilizes a SvelteKit front-end and Supabase for real-time data updates. Loading states should be seamlessly integrated with these existing components without significant architectural changes.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Analysis:** Review the user interactions across the application to identify areas where loading states are required.
2. **Design:** Develop a consistent design for loading indicators that aligns with MeshHook's visual language. This includes defining animations, colors, and positioning.
3. **Implementation:** 
   - Use Svelte's reactive declarations to manage loading states.
   - Integrate loading indicators with existing async operations.
   - Ensure that loading states are accessible.
4. **Testing:** Test loading states across different devices and network conditions to ensure they are displayed correctly and timely.
5. **Documentation:** Update the component library and UX guidelines with the new loading state designs and usage instructions.

### Data Model

No changes to the data model are required for this task.

### API Endpoints

No new API endpoints are required for this task.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Loading indicators are present for all asynchronous operations.
- [ ] Loading states are consistent in design across the application.
- [ ] Performance benchmarks are met, with loading states not introducing significant delays.
- [ ] Accessibility standards are adhered to, with loading states being screen-reader friendly.
- [ ] Manual and automated tests confirm loading states behave as expected across supported browsers and devices.
- [ ] Documentation is updated to reflect the implementation of loading states.

## Dependencies

### Technical Dependencies

- SvelteKit for front-end development.
- Supabase for real-time data.

### Prerequisite Tasks

- Review of the current UI components and operations that require loading states.

## Implementation Notes

### Development Guidelines

- Utilize Svelte's reactivity to manage state transitions.
- Follow the existing coding standards for CSS and JS in the project.
- Implement responsive designs for loading states to ensure compatibility with mobile devices.

### Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests:** Verify that loading states are triggered and dismissed as expected.
- **Integration Tests:** Ensure that loading states integrate well with existing async operations and APIs.
- **Accessibility Tests:** Use tools like axe-core to validate that loading states meet accessibility standards.

### Security Considerations

Loading states should not expose any sensitive information about the underlying processes or data.

### Monitoring & Observability

While loading states primarily impact the front-end, it's crucial to monitor for any unexpected performance degradation associated with these changes.
