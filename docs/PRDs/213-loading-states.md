# PRD: Implementation of Loading States (Issue #213)

## Overview

The task of implementing loading states is critical to enhancing the user experience within the MeshHook platform. This work aligns with the overarching goal of MeshHook to deliver a visually simple and durable workflow engine that is easy to use and understand. By introducing clear and informative loading indicators, we aim to maintain user engagement and minimize confusion during asynchronous operations, thereby improving the overall usability and responsiveness of the application.

### Purpose

The purpose of this task is to implement visually consistent and informative loading states across various components of the MeshHook platform, including webhook processing, workflow execution, and live log updates. This will provide immediate feedback to users during asynchronous operations, enhancing the user experience.

### Alignment with Project Goals

Implementing loading states directly supports MeshHook's goals by:
- **Enhancing Usability:** Making the application more intuitive and responsive.
- **Improving Feedback Mechanisms:** Offering immediate visual feedback during operations, which is crucial for a seamless user experience.
- **Maintaining Performance and Reliability:** Ensuring loading indicators are lightweight and do not affect the application's performance.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

1. **Loading Indicators:** Develop and implement loading indicators for:
   - Webhook intake and processing.
   - Workflow execution and status updates.
   - Fetching and displaying live logs.
2. **Visual Consistency:** Ensure that loading indicators are consistent in design, utilizing MeshHook's UI theme.
3. **Informative Feedback:** Provide users with information about the ongoing process and expected completion time, where feasible.
4. **Error Handling:** Introduce error and timeout states for operations that do not complete successfully within a predefined timeframe.

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** Ensure that the loading indicators are optimized for performance, with minimal impact on the application's responsiveness.
- **Accessibility:** Adhere to accessibility standards, ensuring that loading states are perceivable to all users.
- **Maintainability:** Design the implementation to be easily extensible for future enhancements and integrations.

## Technical Specifications

### Architecture Context

MeshHook utilizes a SvelteKit/Svelte 5 front-end and Supabase Realtime for backend operations. The loading state enhancements should integrate seamlessly with these technologies, leveraging Svelte's reactivity and Supabase's real-time capabilities without necessitating significant architectural changes.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Design:** Collaborate with the UX/UI team to design loading indicators that complement MeshHook's design language.
2. **Identify Integration Points:** Pinpoint areas within the application requiring loading states, including asynchronous data fetches and long-running operations.
3. **Component Development:** Create a reusable Svelte component for loading indicators that can be integrated across the application.
4. **Integration:** Embed the loading component within the application at identified points, ensuring activation during all relevant asynchronous operations.
5. **Testing:** Conduct comprehensive testing to guarantee that loading states function correctly and do not introduce performance bottlenecks.

### Data Model and API Endpoints

- **Data Model Changes:** None required for the implementation of loading states.
- **API Endpoints:** No new endpoints are needed. However, ensure existing endpoints are optimized for performance to reduce loading times.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Loading indicators are visible during all major asynchronous operations.
- [ ] The design and behavior of loading states are consistent across the application.
- [ ] Performance metrics before and after implementation show no significant degradation.
- [ ] All loading states meet accessibility standards.
- [ ] Error and timeout states provide clear, informative feedback to the user.

## Dependencies

### Technical Dependencies

- SvelteKit for frontend development.
- Supabase Realtime for backend operations.

### Prerequisite Tasks

- Finalize UX/UI designs for loading indicators.

## Implementation Notes

### Development Guidelines

- Utilize modern JavaScript and Svelte best practices for reactive component development.
- Ensure code modularity and reusability for the loading component.
- Follow the established MeshHook coding standards and review processes.

### Testing Strategy

- **Unit Testing:** Ensure the loading component is fully covered by unit tests.
- **Integration Testing:** Test the loading states within the context of the application to ensure they trigger and dismiss correctly.
- **Manual Testing:** Perform manual user experience testing to validate the loading states' effectiveness and responsiveness.

### Security Considerations

- Ensure that the implementation of loading states does not expose sensitive information or provide attack vectors for malicious users.

### Monitoring & Observability

- Monitor application performance and responsiveness pre and post-implementation to ensure no adverse impact.
