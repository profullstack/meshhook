# PRD: Test Webhook Functionality

## 1. Overview

This PRD outlines the requirements and implementation strategy for testing the webhook functionality within MeshHook, a webhook-first, deterministic, Postgres-native workflow engine. Given MeshHook's objectives to combine the ease of n8n's visual workflow creation with Temporal's durability, the testing of webhook functionality is critical to ensuring the system's reliability, performance, and security. This task aligns with the project's Phase 5 milestone: Webhook System, specifically focusing on the Webhook Management UI.

### Objective

The primary objective is to validate the reliability, performance, and security of MeshHook's webhook system through comprehensive testing, both automated and manual. This involves establishing a controlled test environment, developing extensive test cases, and documenting the procedures to ensure consistent, repeatable testing processes.

## 2. Functional Requirements

1. **Test Environment Setup**: Create a test environment that closely mirrors the production environment to ensure accurate testing conditions.
2. **Test Cases Development**: Develop detailed test cases that cover:
   - Success and failure scenarios for webhook reception and processing.
   - Edge cases, including high-load scenarios and concurrent webhook processing.
   - Signature verification failures and handling of invalid payloads.
3. **Automated Testing Implementation**: Integrate automated tests within the CI/CD pipeline to ensure consistent execution during development.
4. **Manual Testing Procedures**: Document the steps for manual testing, including scenarios not covered or feasible by automated tests.
5. **Documentation**: Maintain comprehensive documentation of test cases, results, and testing procedures.

## 3. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance**: Webhook processing should meet predefined performance benchmarks, including latency and throughput metrics.
- **Reliability**: Aim for a 99.9% success rate in webhook delivery and processing under standard operational conditions.
- **Security**: Ensure that webhook data transmission and processing adhere to security best practices, including encrypted transmissions and signature verifications.

## 4. Technical Specifications

### Architecture Context

MeshHook leverages SvelteKit for its frontend and Supabase (including Postgres and Realtime) for backend functionalities. The testing strategy must consider the webhook intake mechanism and its processing pipeline, ensuring seamless integration with the existing architecture.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Analysis**: Conduct a thorough review of the existing webhook implementation to identify all integration points and potential areas for testing.
2. **Test Environment Setup**:
   - Utilize Docker or a similar containerization tool to replicate the production environment.
   - Configure Supabase services to match production settings.
3. **Test Cases Development**:
   - Utilize Jest for writing unit and integration tests.
   - Prepare manual testing scenarios and checklists.
4. **Automated Testing**:
   - Integrate testing scripts into the CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions or a similar tool.
   - Ensure coverage for all developed test cases.
5. **Manual Testing**:
   - Perform manual tests based on the prepared scenarios and document the outcomes.
6. **Review and Documentation**:
   - Regularly review test outcomes and update documentation to reflect any changes or updates in the testing process.

### Data Model Changes

No changes to the data model are required for this task. Existing structures (`webhook_events` and `webhook_logs`) will be utilized for logging and monitoring purposes.

### API Endpoints

No new API endpoints are needed for this task. However, existing endpoints related to webhook processing will be subject to testing.

## 5. Acceptance Criteria

- Automated and manual tests cover all defined scenarios, including success, failure, and edge cases.
- The test environment accurately reflects the production setup, and all tests are repeatable in this environment.
- Documentation accurately reflects the testing process, including setup, execution, and results.
- Performance benchmarks are met or exceeded, with no critical issues identified.
- Security measures, including signature verification, are validated through testing.

## 6. Dependencies

### Technical Dependencies

- Access to the existing MeshHook codebase for integration and testing.
- Supabase and Docker (or equivalent) for setting up the test environment.
- CI/CD tooling access for implementing automated tests.

### Prerequisite Tasks

- Prior completion of all webhook functionality development as outlined in previous phases.

## 7. Implementation Notes

### Development Guidelines

- Adhere to MeshHook's existing coding standards and architectural patterns.
- Utilize Jest for unit and integration tests, ensuring comprehensive coverage.
- Document all test cases, including the purpose and expected outcomes.

### Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests**: Focus on individual functions and components within the webhook system.
- **Integration Tests**: Test the end-to-end webhook functionality from receipt through processing.
- **Manual Tests**: Execute manual tests for scenarios not covered by automated testing.

### Security Considerations

- Implement and test secure practices, including payload encryption and signature verification.
- Ensure that logging and monitoring tools do not capture or display sensitive information.

### Monitoring & Observability

- Utilize Supabase Realtime for live monitoring of webhook events during testing.
- Implement logging for all stages of webhook processing to aid in debugging and performance analysis.

By following this PRD, MeshHook will ensure that its webhook functionality is robust, secure, and performant, aligning with the project's overarching goals and user expectations.
