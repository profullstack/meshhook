# PRD: Signature Key Management System

## Overview

The development of a Signature Key Management System within MeshHook's Webhook Management UI is aimed at enhancing the security mechanisms of our webhook system. This system will allow users to create, view, revoke, and reactivate signature keys used for webhook verification. By incorporating this feature, we aim to bolster the integrity and trustworthiness of webhook data transmission, aligning with MeshHook's overarching goals of providing secure, reliable, and user-friendly workflow automation solutions.

## 1. Functional Requirements

1. **Key Generation**: Users must be able to generate new signature keys via the UI, which will be used to sign webhook payloads.
2. **Key Listing**: The system should provide a list view of all generated keys, displaying key IDs, creation dates, and status (active/revoked).
3. **Key Revocation**: Users can revoke any key, which should invalidate the key for future webhook verifications.
4. **Key Reactivation**: Provides the ability to reactivate previously revoked keys.
5. **Audit Logging**: Every action related to key management (generation, revocation, reactivation) must be logged for audit and compliance purposes.

## 2. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance**: Management operations must be swift, ensuring that actions are reflected in the UI without noticeable delays.
- **Security**: Keys must be securely stored (encrypted at rest) and managed, with secure transmission over HTTPS. Access to key management functions should be strictly controlled.
- **Usability**: The UI for managing keys must be intuitive, fitting seamlessly within the existing MeshHook interface.
- **Scalability**: The system should efficiently handle a large volume of keys without performance degradation.

## 3. Technical Specifications

### Architecture Context

MeshHook's architecture comprises a SvelteKit-based frontend and a Supabase-backed backend. The Signature Key Management System will be integrated into this existing framework, utilizing Supabase for secure storage and management of signature keys.

### Implementation Approach

1. **UI Design**: Create intuitive UI mockups for key management, ensuring consistency with MeshHook's design language.
2. **Schema Design**: Add a `signature_keys` table to the database schema, including necessary fields such as key ID, project ID, key value (encrypted), status, and timestamps.
3. **Backend Implementation**:
    - Develop API endpoints for key creation, listing, revocation, and reactivation.
    - Implement audit logging mechanisms for key management actions.
4. **Frontend Implementation**:
    - Build UI components based on the approved mockups.
    - Integrate UI components with backend APIs for key management.
5. **Security Measures**:
    - Encrypt signature keys at rest in the database.
    - Secure API endpoints with proper authentication and authorization checks.

### Data Model

**New Table: `signature_keys`**

- `id` (UUID): Primary key.
- `project_id` (UUID): Links to the `projects` table, enforcing RLS.
- `key` (Text): Encrypted signature key.
- `status` (Enum): Key status (`active` or `revoked`).
- `created_at` (Timestamp): Key creation timestamp.
- `revoked_at` (Nullable Timestamp): Timestamp of key revocation, if applicable.

### API Endpoints

- **Generate Key**: `POST /keys/generate`
- **List Keys**: `GET /keys`
- **Revoke Key**: `POST /keys/{id}/revoke`
- **Reactivate Key**: `POST /keys/{id}/reactivate`

## 4. Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Signature Key Management UI is fully implemented and consistent with MeshHook design standards.
- [ ] Users can successfully generate, list, revoke, and reactivate keys.
- [ ] Key management actions are accurately logged for auditing.
- [ ] Comprehensive tests (unit and integration) are written and pass successfully.
- [ ] API and database schema changes are well-documented.
- [ ] Code review confirms adherence to project standards and successful merge into the main branch.

## 5. Dependencies

- MeshHook's existing SvelteKit frontend and Supabase backend infrastructure.
- Design tools for UI mockups.

## 6. Implementation Notes

### Development Guidelines

- Adhere to MeshHook's coding conventions and best practices.
- Utilize encryption for secure storage of signature keys in the database.
- Implement asynchronous operations with async/await for improved readability and performance.

### Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests**: Focus on backend logic, particularly API endpoints and encryption mechanisms.
- **Integration Tests**: Ensure the entire key management workflow operates as expected, from UI actions to database updates.
- **UI Tests**: Verify that the key management UI functions correctly, including form validations and error handling.

### Security Considerations

- Enforce RLS on all database operations related to the `signature_keys` table.
- Utilize strong, up-to-date encryption standards for storing signature keys.
- Protect key management API endpoints with robust authentication and authorization.

### Monitoring & Observability

- Implement detailed logging for all key management activities.
- Monitor performance metrics and error rates for key management operations to ensure system reliability.

By adhering to these guidelines and requirements, the Signature Key Management System will significantly enhance the security and usability of MeshHook's webhook system, providing users with a robust set of tools for managing webhook signature keys.
