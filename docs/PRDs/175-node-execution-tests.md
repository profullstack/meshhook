# PRD: Node Execution Tests for MeshHook Workflow Engine

## 1. Overview

The MeshHook workflow engine, designed to provide a robust, secure, and efficient platform for automating workflows, is now entering Phase 7: Testing, with a focus on ensuring the reliability and stability of its individual nodes. This document outlines the requirements for implementing node execution tests, which are critical to achieving MeshHook's core objectives.

### Purpose

The purpose of node execution tests is to verify the correct operation of each node within a workflow under various conditions. These tests are essential for:
- Ensuring that each node behaves as expected.
- Preventing regressions due to changes in node logic or dependencies.
- Validating the system's handling of both expected inputs and edge cases.
- Upholding the project's commitment to delivering a deterministic, durable workflow engine.

## 2. Requirements

### Functional Requirements

1. **Comprehensive Testing:** Develop tests for all node types: `transform`, `http_call`, `branch`, `delay`, `terminate`.
2. **Scenario Coverage:** Include tests for normal operations, error handling, retries, timeouts, and edge cases.
3. **Realistic Test Data:** Employ a variety of datasets to accurately simulate both typical and extreme scenarios.
4. **Integration Verification:** Test the interaction of nodes with the database, external services, and other nodes.

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** Ensure tests run efficiently to maintain swift development cycles and CI/CD processes.
- **Consistency:** Achieve reliable test outcomes that are consistent across runs.
- **Security:** Prevent any potential exposure of sensitive information through test executions.
- **Maintainability:** Write clear, well-documented test code that is easy to understand and update.

## 3. Technical Specifications

### Architecture Context

- **SvelteKit/Svelte 5 Integration:** Tests must align with the existing application and worker architecture for seamless integration.
- **Database Interactions:** Utilize transaction rollbacks or dedicated test databases for tests that require database access, ensuring no impact on actual data.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Framework Selection:** Adopt Jest or a comparable framework for defining and executing tests.
2. **Mocking Strategies:** Use mocking for external HTTP requests and database interactions, focusing on isolating node behaviors.
3. **Test-Driven Development:**
   - Begin by writing tests for different scenarios across all node types.
   - Adjust or enhance node logic to fulfill test conditions.
   - Optimize both code and tests for clarity and performance.
4. **Integration with Existing Tests:** Ensure new node tests complement existing integration and end-to-end testing frameworks.
5. **CI/CD Integration:** Automate the execution of node tests within the project's continuous integration and deployment pipeline.

### Data Model and API Endpoints

- **No Changes Required:** This testing phase does not necessitate modifications to the data model or API endpoints.

## 4. Acceptance Criteria

- Comprehensive tests developed for all node types.
- Tests demonstrate consistent passing results.
- Coverage includes a broad spectrum of operational and edge case scenarios.
- Test code is well-documented, adhering to project standards.
- Successful integration within the CI/CD pipeline is confirmed.

## 5. Dependencies and Prerequisites

### Technical Dependencies

- Access to the MeshHook codebase and development environment.
- Selection and setup of a testing framework (e.g., Jest).
- Availability of mocking tools/libraries.

### Prerequisite Tasks

- Documentation and definition of node logic and interfaces.
- Confirmation of development environment setup and access to necessary services.

## 6. Implementation Notes

### Development Guidelines

- Adhere to ES2024+ coding standards.
- Employ async/await for handling asynchronous operations.
- Ensure linting of code and test scripts as per project configurations.

### Testing Strategy

- **Mocking:** Leverage jest.mock or equivalent for simulating external APIs and database interactions.
- **Data Sets:** Craft test datasets to encompass typical, boundary, and erroneous conditions.
- **Parallel Execution:** Configure the testing framework to run tests in parallel to expedite the process.

### Security Considerations

- Exclude sensitive information from test data and mock responses.
- Follow established security practices as outlined in the project's Security Guidelines.

### Monitoring and Observability

- Incorporate logging within tests to aid in diagnosing failures and understanding performance implications.

This PRD aims to ensure that the MeshHook project advances with confidence in the reliability and performance of its workflow nodes, pivotal to sustaining the engine's deterministic and durable nature.
