# PRD: Workflow Settings

**Issue:** [#129](https://github.com/profullstack/meshhook/issues/129)  
**Milestone:** Phase 3: Frontend (SvelteKit)  
**Labels:** workflow-management, hacktoberfest  
**Phase:** Phase 3  
**Section:** Workflow Management

---

## 1. Overview

The objective of this task is to implement and enhance the workflow settings functionality within MeshHook, aligning with the application's core features and project goals. Workflow settings are crucial for users to configure and manage various aspects of their workflows, including trigger configurations, node settings, execution parameters, and security settings. This feature is aimed at providing users with the flexibility to customize their workflows to meet specific requirements, while maintaining the simplicity and ease of use that MeshHook is known for.

### Purpose

- To allow users to configure workflow-specific settings, enhancing customization and control.
- To align with MeshHook's goals of delivering a user-friendly, visual DAG builder with robust, durable execution capabilities.

## 2. Functional Requirements

1. **CRUD Operations for Workflow Settings:** Users must be able to create, read, update, and delete settings for each workflow.
2. **UI for Workflow Settings:** Implement a user-friendly interface for configuring workflow settings using SvelteKit/Svelte 5.
3. **Validation and Error Handling:** Ensure input validation for settings and provide clear error messages for invalid configurations.
4. **Versioning and Drafts:** Support versioning of workflow settings, allowing users to save drafts before publishing.
5. **Webhook Trigger Configuration:** Include settings for webhook triggers, such as URL generation, signature verification method selection, and secret key management.
6. **Node Settings Customization:** Allow users to configure settings for individual nodes within the workflow, including timeout values, retry policies, and data transformation scripts.
7. **Execution Parameters:** Enable users to set global execution parameters for the workflow, such as maximum execution time, concurrency limits, and error handling strategies.

## 3. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** Workflow settings operations must be responsive, aiming for sub-second load and save times.
- **Reliability:** Ensure high availability and error resilience, maintaining MeshHook's 99.9% uptime goal.
- **Security:** Adhere to MeshHook's security practices, including RLS, secure storage and handling of secrets, and input validation to prevent injection attacks.
- **Maintainability:** Code should be clean, well-commented, and adhere to the project's coding standards and best practices.

## 4. Technical Specifications

### Architecture Context

MeshHook utilizes a SvelteKit/Svelte 5 frontend with a Supabase backend, leveraging Postgres for data storage and queuing, and Realtime for log streaming.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Analysis:** Review the current workflow management features to understand the settings' scope.
2. **UI Design:** Design the UI components for settings management, ensuring they integrate seamlessly with the existing DAG builder interface.
3. **Backend Integration:** Develop the necessary API endpoints and database schema modifications to support new settings, focusing on secure data handling and validation.
4. **Frontend Implementation:** Implement the settings UI in SvelteKit, ensuring dynamic updates and immediate feedback for user actions.
5. **Testing and Validation:** Conduct thorough testing, including unit, integration, and user acceptance tests, to ensure reliability and usability.
6. **Documentation:** Update the project documentation to include details on managing workflow settings.

### Data Model Changes

- A new `workflow_settings` table may be introduced to store user-defined settings for each workflow, linked to the `workflows` table via a foreign key.

### API Endpoints

- **GET `/api/workflows/{id}/settings`:** Retrieve the current settings for a workflow.
- **PUT `/api/workflows/{id}/settings`:** Update the settings for a workflow.

## 5. Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] CRUD operations for workflow settings are implemented and functional.
- [ ] UI for managing workflow settings is intuitive and aligns with MeshHook's design language.
- [ ] Input validation and error handling are implemented for all settings.
- [ ] Changes to workflow settings are versioned, with support for drafts and publishing.
- [ ] Performance, security, and reliability standards are met.
- [ ] Documentation is updated to reflect the new workflow settings feature.

## 6. Dependencies

- SvelteKit/Svelte 5 for frontend development.
- Supabase for backend services.
- Existing MeshHook codebase and infrastructure.

## 7. Implementation Notes

### Development Guidelines

- Utilize modern JavaScript features and follow the project's existing coding standards.
- Implement features in a modular, reusable manner where possible.
- Prioritize security and performance at all stages of development.

### Testing Strategy

- Implement unit tests for new backend logic and API endpoints.
- Develop integration tests to cover the interaction between the frontend, API, and database.
- Perform manual end-to-end testing with realistic user scenarios.

### Security Considerations

- Ensure all user input is validated and sanitized to prevent injection attacks.
- Securely handle secrets and sensitive settings, using encryption for storage and secure APIs for management.
- Follow MeshHook's RLS policies for multi-tenancy support.

### Monitoring & Observability

- Implement logging for key actions and settings changes, integrating with Supabase Realtime where applicable.
- Monitor performance metrics, particularly for settings management operations, to detect and address any bottlenecks or issues promptly.
