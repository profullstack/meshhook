# PRD: Svelte 5 Configuration for MeshHook

## Overview

As part of Phase 3: Frontend (SvelteKit) in the MeshHook project development, this task focuses on configuring Svelte 5 to align with the overarching goals of the project. The MeshHook project seeks to offer a webhook-first, deterministic, Postgres-native workflow engine that combines the visual simplicity of n8n with the durability of Temporal, all under a more flexible licensing model.

**Objective:** Efficiently configure Svelte 5 to serve as the foundation for building a visually intuitive DAG builder and other user-facing components, ensuring compatibility, performance, and maintainability.

### Goals Alignment

- **Visual DAG Builder:** Leveraging Svelte 5's capabilities to enhance UI performance and developer experience in creating the visual DAG builder.
- **Maintainability and Scalability:** Establishing a robust frontend architecture that can grow with the project's needs.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

1. **Svelte 5 Setup:** Configure the Svelte 5 environment within the existing SvelteKit application structure.
2. **Compatibility Check:** Ensure backward compatibility with existing SvelteKit features and integrations.
3. **Component Library Integration:** Adapt any existing UI components for compatibility with Svelte 5, focusing on performance and reusability.
4. **Routing and SSR:** Verify and configure SvelteKit's routing and Server-Side Rendering (SSR) capabilities to work seamlessly with Svelte 5.
5. **State Management:** Implement or adapt state management solutions that are compatible with Svelte 5, ensuring efficient data flow across the application.

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** Achieve optimal frontend performance, minimizing load times and leveraging Svelte 5's compile-time optimizations.
- **Reliability:** Ensure a stable development environment and application runtime, with comprehensive error handling.
- **Security:** Adhere to best practices in frontend security, particularly in handling user input and data rendering.
- **Maintainability:** Write clean, well-organized, and documented code that follows the project's coding standards.

## Technical Specifications

### Architecture Context

MeshHook utilizes a hybrid architecture with SvelteKit serving both SSR and API needs, integrated with Supabase for backend services. Svelte 5's configuration must integrate seamlessly within this setup, enhancing the frontend while maintaining compatibility with backend services and existing workflows.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Preparation:** Review the existing SvelteKit project setup and document any specific customizations or configurations.
2. **Configuration:** Install and configure Svelte 5, including necessary compiler and runtime options for SvelteKit integration.
3. **Component Upgrade:** Assess and upgrade existing Svelte components to ensure compatibility with Svelte 5, refactoring as needed for performance optimizations.
4. **Testing and Verification:** Implement unit and integration tests for new configurations and components, ensuring no regressions in functionality.
5. **Documentation:** Update the project's technical documentation to reflect changes and additions made during the Svelte 5 configuration process.

### Data Model and API Endpoints

No changes to the data model or new API endpoints are required for this task. The focus remains on frontend configuration and component compatibility.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Svelte 5 is configured and integrated into the MeshHook project without disrupting existing functionalities.
- [ ] All existing components are assessed and, if necessary, upgraded to work with Svelte 5, with performance considerations.
- [ ] Application routing and SSR capabilities function as expected in the SvelteKit environment.
- [ ] Frontend performance meets or exceeds previous benchmarks.
- [ ] Documentation is updated to reflect the Svelte 5 configuration process and any changes made to components or setup.

## Dependencies and Prerequisites

- Access to the MeshHook SvelteKit codebase.
- Familiarity with the current project setup and SvelteKit.
- Necessary permissions for updating project dependencies and configurations.

## Implementation Notes

### Development Guidelines

- Utilize the latest ECMAScript standards for JavaScript code.
- Follow the existing project structure for Svelte components and services.
- Prioritize clean code, modularity, and reusability of components.

### Testing Strategy

- Implement unit tests for new or modified components, ensuring they function correctly in isolation.
- Conduct integration tests to verify that the application behaves as expected with the new Svelte 5 configuration.
- Perform manual testing, especially for UI and interactive elements, to ensure a smooth user experience.

### Security Considerations

- Validate all user inputs and sanitize outputs to prevent XSS attacks.
- Ensure that SSR does not inadvertently expose sensitive data or server-side configurations.

### Monitoring and Observability

- Utilize browser performance tools to monitor frontend performance and identify potential bottlenecks.
- Implement logging for critical errors and performance issues, facilitating quick debugging and resolution.
