title Security Audit Process for MeshHook

actor Auditor
participant "Security Tools" as Tools
database "MeshHook Codebase" as Codebase
database "Third-Party Libraries" as Libraries
participant "MeshHook Components" as Components
participant "API Endpoints" as API
participant "Data Models" as DataModels
cloud "Regulatory Standards" as Standards

== Preparation ==
Auditor -> Codebase : Catalogue components\nand services
Auditor -> Components : Define audit scope

== Execution ==
group Static Analysis
    Auditor -> Tools : Use static code analysis
    Tools -> Codebase : Analyze code
    Tools --> Auditor : Report findings
end

group Dynamic Analysis and Penetration Testing
    Auditor -> Tools : Conduct dynamic analysis
    Tools -> Components : Test runtime vulnerabilities
    Tools --> Auditor : Report findings
end

group Dependency and Compliance Check
    Auditor -> Libraries : Check for vulnerabilities
    Libraries --> Auditor : Report known vulnerabilities
    Auditor -> Standards : Verify compliance
    Standards --> Auditor : Compliance status
end

group API and Data Model Evaluation
    Auditor -> API : Evaluate endpoints
    API --> Auditor : Endpoint vulnerabilities
    Auditor -> DataModels : Assess data handling
    DataModels --> Auditor : Model vulnerabilities
end

== Reporting ==
Auditor -> Components : Document findings
Auditor -> API : Document findings
Auditor -> DataModels : Document findings

== Remediation Plan ==
Auditor -> Components : Propose mitigation strategies
Auditor -> API : Propose improvements
Auditor -> DataModels : Suggest model adjustments

== Validation ==
Auditor -> Components : Re-assess post-remediation
Auditor -> API : Re-assess post-remediation
Auditor -> DataModels : Re-assess post-remediation
