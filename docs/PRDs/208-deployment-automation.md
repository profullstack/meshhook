# PRD: Deployment Automation for MeshHook

## Overview

The deployment automation initiative for MeshHook is a strategic effort to streamline and secure the process of deploying our workflow engine across various environments. This task is aligned with the project's Phase 9 objectives, focusing on Deployment & Operations. By automating deployment processes, MeshHook aims to achieve faster release cycles, ensure consistency across deployments, minimize human errors, and enhance security measures. This initiative supports MeshHook's core features, including webhook triggers, visual DAG builder, durable runs, live logs, and multi-tenant RLS security, by providing a robust and reliable deployment foundation.

## Objectives

- Automate the deployment process across different environments (development, staging, production).
- Ensure secure handling and deployment of code changes with minimal manual intervention.
- Support the project's scalability, reliability, and security requirements.

## Functional Requirements

1. **Automated Deployment Pipelines:** Develop automated pipelines for deploying MeshHook services, ensuring minimal manual intervention is required.
2. **Environment Management:** Automate the configuration and management of multiple environments (development, staging, production), including the deployment of environment-specific configurations.
3. **Version Control and Rollback:** Implement version control mechanisms for deployments with the ability to rollback to previous versions seamlessly in case of deployment failures.
4. **Deployment Notification System:** Integrate a notification system to alert relevant stakeholders about the status of deployments, including successes and failures.

## Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** Deployment processes must complete in a timely manner, ensuring quick release cycles.
- **Reliability:** Achieve a deployment success rate of 99.9%, with mechanisms to automatically detect and recover from failures.
- **Security:** Secure handling of secrets and credentials, ensuring they are encrypted and only accessible by authorized systems and personnel.
- **Maintainability:** Develop clear, well-documented, and easily updatable deployment scripts and configurations.

## Technical Specifications

### Architecture Context

MeshHook's architecture involves several key components including SvelteKit for the frontend, Supabase for backend services, and dedicated workers for orchestration. The deployment automation must integrate seamlessly with these components, respecting their operational environments and constraints.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Select Deployment and CI/CD Tools:** Evaluate and select tools such as GitHub Actions for CI/CD and Terraform for infrastructure as code, considering the project's existing technology stack and cloud provider capabilities.
2. **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Define all cloud infrastructure requirements using IaC, ensuring reproducibility and version control of infrastructure changes.
3. **CI/CD Pipeline Configuration:** Configure CI/CD pipelines to automate the testing, building, and deployment processes, integrating environment-specific configurations and secrets management.
4. **Monitoring and Notifications:** Implement monitoring for the deployment processes and configure alerts for deployment statuses, integrating with communication tools for real-time notifications.

### Data Model

No changes to the existing data model are required for the implementation of deployment automation. Any necessary adjustments for deployment tracking or configuration will be documented accordingly.

### API Endpoints

Not applicable for this task.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Automated deployment pipelines are configured and operational for all environments.
- [ ] Environment-specific configurations are correctly applied during deployments.
- [ ] Rollback mechanisms are in place and tested, ensuring quick recovery from failed deployments.
- [ ] The deployment notification system is operational, delivering timely alerts on deployment statuses.
- [ ] Documentation is updated to reflect the new deployment processes and configurations.
- [ ] Security practices for managing secrets and credentials are implemented and verified.

## Dependencies

### Technical Dependencies

- Access to the project's CI/CD tools (e.g., GitHub Actions) and cloud infrastructure accounts.
- Infrastructure as code tools (e.g., Terraform) for defining and managing infrastructure.

### Prerequisite Tasks

- Review and consolidation of existing deployment scripts and environments.
- Setup and configuration of selected CI/CD and IaC tools.

## Implementation Notes

### Development Guidelines

- Adhere to Infrastructure as Code best practices, ensuring all infrastructure components are defined in code and version-controlled.
- Implement secure handling of secrets using encrypted storage and limited access controls.
- Ensure deployment scripts are idempotent, allowing for reliable re-execution without unintended side effects.

### Testing Strategy

- **Integration Testing:** Test the deployment process in a staging environment to ensure integration points and deployment steps function as expected.
- **Security Testing:** Conduct security assessments on the deployment process, focusing on secret management and access controls.

### Security Considerations

- Implement encryption for all sensitive information handled during deployments.
- Use role-based access controls to limit access to deployment systems and data.
- Regularly audit and rotate secrets involved in the deployment process.

### Monitoring & Observability

- Implement detailed logging for all deployment activities, allowing for easy troubleshooting and monitoring.
- Set up alerts based on deployment outcomes and critical errors to ensure quick response times to deployment issues.
