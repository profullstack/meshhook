# PRD: Deployment Automation

## Overview

The goal of this PRD is to outline the implementation of automated deployment processes for MeshHook, aligning with Phase 9 of our project roadmap: Deployment & Operations. This initiative is crucial for streamlining our deployment process, ensuring consistency across environments, and reducing manual overhead. By automating deployments, we aim to achieve faster rollout times, improved reliability, and the ability to easily scale our operations.

Deployment automation will integrate with our existing CI/CD workflows, leveraging our project's commitment to security, performance, and maintainability. This initiative directly supports our core project goals, including our webhook triggers, visual DAG builder, durable runs, live logs, and multi-tenant security model.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

1. **Automated Deployments:** Implement an automated process for deploying MeshHook applications and services.
2. **Environment Configuration:** Support multiple environments (e.g., development, staging, production) with environment-specific configurations.
3. **Rollback Mechanism:** Provide a mechanism to rollback deployments to a previous stable version in case of failures.
4. **Notifications:** Integrate deployment notifications to inform stakeholders about deployment statuses via email or messaging platforms.

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** Ensure the deployment process completes within a predefined time frame to minimize downtime.
- **Reliability:** Achieve a 99.9% success rate for deployments with automated error detection and handling.
- **Security:** Securely manage secrets and credentials, ensuring they are not exposed in logs or to unauthorized persons.
- **Maintainability:** Ensure the deployment scripts and configurations are well-documented, version-controlled, and easily updateable.

## Technical Specifications

### Architecture Context

MeshHook utilizes a robust architecture comprising SvelteKit for SSR/API, Supabase for backend services, and dedicated workers for orchestration and HTTP execution. The deployment automation must integrate seamlessly with these components, leveraging existing CI/CD tools (e.g., GitHub Actions, GitLab CI) and infrastructure as code (IaC) practices for consistency and repeatability.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Tool Selection:** Choose appropriate tools for IaC (e.g., Terraform, CloudFormation) and CI/CD (e.g., GitHub Actions, GitLab CI).
2. **Infrastructure Automation:** Define infrastructure as code for all required resources, ensuring they can be provisioned, updated, and destroyed programmatically.
3. **CI/CD Pipeline Integration:** Integrate deployment steps into the CI/CD pipeline, including environment setup, deployment, health checks, and rollback procedures.
4. **Secrets Management:** Implement secure secrets management using tools like HashiCorp Vault or AWS Secrets Manager, integrating them with the CI/CD pipeline.
5. **Monitoring and Alerts:** Set up monitoring for the deployment process and configure alerts for failures or significant deployment events.

### Data Model

No new data model changes are required for this task. Any adjustments to the database schema for deployment tracking or configuration management will be documented and reviewed as part of the implementation process.

### API Endpoints

Not applicable for this task.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Automated deployment process implemented and documented.
- Deployments can be triggered manually or automatically on code merges to specific branches.
- Environment-specific configurations are managed and applied correctly.
- Rollback procedures are tested and documented, with the ability to revert to the last stable version.
- Deployment notifications are sent out successfully upon completion or failure.
- All CI/CD pipeline runs and deployment processes are logged for auditing purposes.
- Security practices for secrets management are implemented and verified.

## Dependencies

### Technical Dependencies

- Existing CI/CD pipeline setup (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI).
- Infrastructure as code tools (Terraform, CloudFormation).
- Secrets management solution (HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager).
- Access to cloud provider accounts and services.

### Prerequisite Tasks

- Review and update existing CI/CD pipelines.
- Access setup for necessary tools and services.
- Documentation of current deployment processes and configurations.

## Implementation Notes

### Development Guidelines

- Follow Infrastructure as Code best practices for creating reproducible and consistent environments.
- Use secure practices for handling secrets and credentials within CI/CD pipelines.
- Document all steps of the deployment process, including setup, execution, and rollback procedures.

### Testing Strategy

- **Unit Testing:** N/A for deployment scripts, but validation tools can be used for IaC configurations.
- **Integration Testing:** Test the deployment process in a controlled staging environment to ensure that all components work together as expected.
- **Security Testing:** Perform security audits on the deployment process, especially focusing on how secrets are handled.

### Security Considerations

- Ensure all communications with cloud services are encrypted.
- Use role-based access control (RBAC) to limit access to deployment tools and services.
- Regularly rotate secrets and credentials used in the deployment process.

### Monitoring & Observability

- Implement logging for all steps of the deployment process.
- Set up monitoring and alerts for key metrics and events related to deployments.
- Utilize dashboard tools to visualize deployment statuses and health.
