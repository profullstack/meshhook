# PRD: Deployment Automation

**Issue:** [#208](https://github.com/profullstack/meshhook/issues/208)  
**Milestone:** Phase 9: Deployment & Operations  
**Labels:** cicd, hacktoberfest  
**Phase:** Phase 9  
**Section:** CI/CD  

---

## Overview

In the context of MeshHook's development lifecycle, the automation of deployment processes is crucial for ensuring consistent, reliable, and efficient delivery of updates and new features. This task aims to establish a Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline that supports the project's webhook-first, deterministic, Postgres-native workflow engine. By automating the deployment, we align with MeshHook's core goals by reducing manual errors, increasing deployment frequency, and ensuring a secure, maintainable codebase.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

1. **CI/CD Pipeline Setup:** Configure a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions (or a similar platform) that automates the build, test, and deployment processes.
2. **Automated Testing:** Integrate automated testing into the pipeline to run unit, integration, and end-to-end tests on every push to the main branch and pull requests.
3. **Deployment Strategy:** Implement blue-green or canary deployments to minimize downtime and allow rollback in case of issues.
4. **Database Migrations:** Automate database migrations as part of the deployment process, ensuring no data loss or downtime.
5. **Notifications:** Configure notifications for deployment status updates through Slack or email to the development team.

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** Ensure the deployment pipeline is optimized for speed, completing builds and deployments within minutes.
- **Reliability:** Achieve 99.9% pipeline uptime, with built-in redundancy and error handling.
- **Security:** Use secrets management for API keys, database credentials, and other sensitive information, ensuring they are not exposed in logs or repository code.
- **Maintainability:** Define the pipeline as code to version control configurations and allow easy updates and changes.

## Technical Specifications

### Architecture Context

- **GitHub Actions:** Leverage GitHub Actions for the CI/CD pipeline due to its integration with GitHub repositories, ease of use, and flexibility.
- **Supabase:** Utilize Supabase for database migrations within the pipeline, ensuring consistency with the existing platform.
- **SvelteKit/Svelte 5:** Ensure compatibility with SvelteKit for deployments, particularly for SSR/API changes.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Analysis:** Evaluate current deployment procedures and identify areas for automation and optimization.
2. **Pipeline Configuration:** Set up a GitHub Actions workflow that includes steps for testing, building, and deploying the application. This includes:
   - Defining jobs for linting, unit testing, and integration testing.
   - Configuring a deployment job that handles artifact packaging and deployment to the production environment.
   - Implementing database migration scripts to run as part of the deployment job.
3. **Testing Integration:** Integrate existing tests into the pipeline, ensuring they run on every commit. Expand coverage as necessary.
4. **Deployment Strategy Implementation:** Configure blue-green deployment scripts that allow seamless switching between production environments.
5. **Monitoring and Notification:** Set up logging for the deployment process and configure alerts for failed deployments.

### Data Model

No changes to the data model are required for this task.

### API Endpoints

No new API endpoints are required for this task.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] CI/CD pipeline configured and operational for MeshHook.
- [ ] Automated tests are executed within the pipeline with results visible on each run.
- [ ] Deployment process automates database migrations without data loss or downtime.
- [ ] Blue-green or canary deployment strategy is implemented and tested.
- [ ] Deployment notifications are sent to the development team.
- [ ] Documentation for the deployment process and pipeline configuration is provided.

## Dependencies

- Access to the GitHub repository with permissions to configure GitHub Actions.
- Existing automated tests ready to be integrated into the pipeline.
- Supabase account access for database migrations.

## Implementation Notes

### Development Guidelines

- Follow the existing project structure and coding standards.
- Ensure all pipeline scripts are well-documented and maintainable.
- Use environment variables and secrets management for sensitive configurations.

### Testing Strategy

- Maintain and expand the test suite to cover critical paths and functionalities.
- Use mocked services where necessary to ensure reliable integration testing.

### Security Considerations

- Encrypt sensitive data using GitHub Secrets and ensure they are not logged or exposed.
- Implement automated security scans within the pipeline to detect vulnerabilities early.

### Monitoring & Observability

- Configure logging for the deployment process to capture and diagnose issues.
- Set up monitoring on the deployment environment to track application performance and error rates.
