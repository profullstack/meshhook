# PRD: Deployment Automation for MeshHook

## Overview

The deployment automation initiative for MeshHook is a strategic effort to streamline and secure the process of deploying our workflow engine across various environments. This task is aligned with the project's Phase 9 objectives, focusing on Deployment & Operations. By automating deployment processes, MeshHook aims to achieve faster release cycles, ensure consistency across deployments, minimize human errors, and enhance security measures. This initiative supports MeshHook's core features, including webhook triggers, visual DAG builder, durable runs, live logs, and multi-tenant RLS security, by providing a robust and reliable deployment foundation.

## Objectives

- Automate the deployment process across different environments (development, staging, production).
- Ensure secure handling and deployment of code changes with minimal manual intervention.
- Support the project's scalability, reliability, and security requirements.

## Functional Requirements

# PRD: Deployment Automation

## Overview

The goal of this PRD is to outline the implementation of automated deployment processes for MeshHook, aligning with Phase 9 of our project roadmap: Deployment & Operations. This initiative is crucial for streamlining our deployment process, ensuring consistency across environments, and reducing manual overhead. By automating deployments, we aim to achieve faster rollout times, improved reliability, and the ability to easily scale our operations.

Deployment automation will integrate with our existing CI/CD workflows, leveraging our project's commitment to security, performance, and maintainability. This initiative directly supports our core project goals, including our webhook triggers, visual DAG builder, durable runs, live logs, and multi-tenant security model.

## Technical Specifications

### Architecture Context

<<<<<<< HEAD
MeshHook's architecture involves several key components including SvelteKit for the frontend, Supabase for backend services, and dedicated workers for orchestration. The deployment automation must integrate seamlessly with these components, respecting their operational environments and constraints.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Select Deployment and CI/CD Tools:** Evaluate and select tools such as GitHub Actions for CI/CD and Terraform for infrastructure as code, considering the project's existing technology stack and cloud provider capabilities.
2. **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Define all cloud infrastructure requirements using IaC, ensuring reproducibility and version control of infrastructure changes.
3. **CI/CD Pipeline Configuration:** Configure CI/CD pipelines to automate the testing, building, and deployment processes, integrating environment-specific configurations and secrets management.
4. **Monitoring and Notifications:** Implement monitoring for the deployment processes and configure alerts for deployment statuses, integrating with communication tools for real-time notifications.

### Data Model

No changes to the existing data model are required for the implementation of deployment automation. Any necessary adjustments for deployment tracking or configuration will be documented accordingly.
=======
MeshHook utilizes a robust architecture comprising SvelteKit for SSR/API, Supabase for backend services, and dedicated workers for orchestration and HTTP execution. The deployment automation must integrate seamlessly with these components, leveraging existing CI/CD tools (e.g., GitHub Actions, GitLab CI) and infrastructure as code (IaC) practices for consistency and repeatability.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Tool Selection:** Choose appropriate tools for IaC (e.g., Terraform, CloudFormation) and CI/CD (e.g., GitHub Actions, GitLab CI).
2. **Infrastructure Automation:** Define infrastructure as code for all required resources, ensuring they can be provisioned, updated, and destroyed programmatically.
3. **CI/CD Pipeline Integration:** Integrate deployment steps into the CI/CD pipeline, including environment setup, deployment, health checks, and rollback procedures.
4. **Secrets Management:** Implement secure secrets management using tools like HashiCorp Vault or AWS Secrets Manager, integrating them with the CI/CD pipeline.
5. **Monitoring and Alerts:** Set up monitoring for the deployment process and configure alerts for failures or significant deployment events.

### Data Model

No new data model changes are required for this task. Any adjustments to the database schema for deployment tracking or configuration management will be documented and reviewed as part of the implementation process.
