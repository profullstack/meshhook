# PRD: Deployment Automation for MeshHook

## 1. Overview

The MeshHook Deployment Automation project is a critical initiative aimed at enhancing the efficiency, reliability, and security of deploying the MeshHook workflow engine across various environments. This initiative is key to achieving MeshHook's Phase 9 objectives within the Deployment & Operations milestone. By automating the deployment process, MeshHook aims to reduce manual intervention, decrease deployment times, increase consistency across environments, and bolster the security posture of the deployment pipeline. This effort is instrumental in supporting MeshHook's commitment to delivering a robust and scalable workflow engine equipped with features like webhook triggers, a visual DAG builder, durable runs, live logs, and multi-tenant RLS security.

## 2. Functional Requirements

1. **Automated Deployment Pipelines:** Develop and implement automated CI/CD pipelines that facilitate the deployment of MeshHook services across development, staging, and production environments with minimal manual intervention.
   
2. **Environment Configuration Management:** Automate the setup and management of environment-specific configurations to ensure that the correct settings are applied during the deployment process for each environment.

3. **Version Control and Deployment Rollback:** Incorporate version control for all deployments with the capability to seamlessly rollback to previous stable versions in case of deployment failures or issues.

4. **Deployment Notification System:** Establish a notification system that alerts stakeholders about deployment statuses, including successful deployments, failures, and warnings, ensuring transparency and prompt responses to deployment outcomes.

## 3. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** Deployment pipelines must be optimized to ensure rapid execution, aiming for deployment processes to complete within minutes, not hours.
  
- **Reliability:** Target a deployment success rate of 99.9%, with built-in mechanisms to detect, notify, and recover from deployment failures automatically.

- **Security:** Ensure the secure handling, storage, and access of secrets, credentials, and codebases throughout the deployment process, employing encryption and access controls.

- **Maintainability:** Deployment scripts, configurations, and pipeline definitions must be clearly documented, version-controlled, and structured for easy updates and maintenance.

## 4. Technical Specifications

### Architecture Context

MeshHook utilizes a modern stack including SvelteKit for its frontend, Supabase for backend services, and dedicated worker processes for task orchestration. The deployment automation solution must integrate seamlessly with these components, supporting the existing cloud infrastructure and software architecture.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Tool Selection:** Choose GitHub Actions for CI/CD processes and Terraform for managing infrastructure as code, aligning with our technology stack and cloud provider capabilities.

2. **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Utilize Terraform to define all required cloud infrastructure, ensuring that infrastructure setup is reproducible, version-controlled, and can be audited.

3. **CI/CD Pipeline Configuration:** Configure pipelines in GitHub Actions to automate testing, building, and deploying MeshHook, including the handling of environment-specific secrets and configurations.

4. **Monitoring and Notifications:** Implement monitoring tools to oversee the deployment processes and configure integration with communication platforms (e.g., Slack, email) for real-time deployment status notifications.

### Data Model and API Endpoints

No direct changes to the MeshHook data model are required for this deployment automation effort. However, any modifications needed for tracking deployments or configurations will be developed and documented as necessary. This project does not necessitate new API endpoints.

## 5. Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Automated deployment pipelines are fully functional for development, staging, and production environments.
- [ ] Environment-specific configurations are accurately applied without manual intervention during deployments.
- [ ] Deployment rollback capabilities are in place, tested, and operational, allowing quick recovery from failed deployments.
- [ ] A deployment notification system is established and consistently delivers accurate alerts regarding deployment statuses.
- [ ] Documentation accurately reflects the deployment automation processes, tools, and configurations.
- [ ] Security measures for handling secrets and credentials during deployment are implemented and have been thoroughly verified.

## 6. Dependencies and Prerequisites

- **Technical Dependencies:** Access to GitHub Actions, Terraform, and cloud infrastructure accounts.
- **Prerequisite Tasks:** Consolidation and review of current deployment scripts, environment configurations, and tool setup.

## 7. Implementation Notes

### Development Guidelines

- Follow best practices for Infrastructure as Code (IaC) to ensure infrastructure setup is reliable, reproducible, and easily audited.
- Securely manage secrets and credentials using encrypted storage solutions and restrict access based on least privilege principles.
- Ensure deployment scripts are idempotent, allowing them to be rerun without causing unintended consequences.

### Testing Strategy

- **Integration Testing:** Conduct thorough testing of the deployment process in a controlled staging environment to ensure all components integrate seamlessly.
- **Security Testing:** Perform security assessments focusing on the management and access control of secrets during the deployment process.

### Security Considerations

- Utilize encryption for all sensitive data handled during deployments.
- Implement role-based access controls (RBAC) to restrict access to deployment systems and sensitive information.
- Regularly review and rotate secrets and credentials involved in the deployment process to mitigate risks.

### Monitoring & Observability

- Implement logging for all deployment activities to enable detailed monitoring and facilitate troubleshooting.
- Configure alerts based on deployment outcomes and critical errors to ensure rapid response to any issues that arise during deployment procedures.

By adhering to this PRD, MeshHook will establish a highly efficient, reliable, and secure deployment automation system that supports the project's goals of delivering a scalable and robust workflow engine.
