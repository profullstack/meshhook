# PRD: Event sourcing engine

**Issue:** [#95](https://github.com/profullstack/meshhook/issues/95)  
**Milestone:** Phase 2: Backend Workers  
**Labels:** orchestrator-worker  
**Phase:** Phase 2  
**Section:** Orchestrator Worker

---

## Overview

This task is part of Phase 2 in the Orchestrator Worker section of the MeshHook project. 

**MeshHook** is a webhook-first, deterministic, Postgres-native workflow engine that delivers n8n's visual simplicity and Temporal's durability without restrictive licensing.

**Task Objective:** Event sourcing engine

This implementation should align with the project's core goals of providing:
- Webhook triggers with signature verification
- Visual DAG builder using SvelteKit/Svelte 5
- Durable, replayable runs via event sourcing
- Live logs via Supabase Realtime
- Multi-tenant RLS security

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

1. Implement the core functionality described in the task: "Event sourcing engine"
5. Document all public APIs and interfaces
6. Follow project coding standards and best practices


### Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** Maintain sub-second response times for user-facing operations
- **Reliability:** Ensure 99.9% uptime with proper error handling and recovery
- **Security:** Follow project security guidelines (RLS, secrets management, audit logging)
- **Maintainability:** Write clean, well-documented code following project conventions

## Technical Specifications

### Architecture Context

- **SvelteKit (SSR/API)**: webhook intake, workflow CRUD, publish versions, run console.
- **Supabase**: Postgres (data + queues), Realtime (log streaming), Storage (artifacts), Edge (cron/timers).
- **Workers**: Orchestrator (state machine + scheduling) and HTTP Executor (robust HTTP with retries/backoff).

### Implementation Approach

The implementation should follow these steps:

1. **Analysis:** Review existing codebase and identify integration points
2. **Design:** Create detailed technical design considering:
   - Data structures and schemas
   - API contracts and interfaces
   - Component architecture
   - Error handling strategies
3. **Implementation:** Write code following TDD approach:
   - Write tests first
   - Implement minimal code to pass tests
   - Refactor for clarity and performance
4. **Integration:** Ensure seamless integration with existing components
5. **Testing:** Comprehensive testing at all levels
6. **Documentation:** Update relevant documentation
7. **Review:** Code review and feedback incorporation

**Key Considerations:**
- Maintain backward compatibility where applicable
- Follow event sourcing patterns for state changes
- Use Postgres for durable storage
- Implement proper error handling and logging
- Consider rate limiting and resource constraints

### Data Model

No new data model changes required for this task. If data model changes are needed during implementation, update `schema.sql` and document changes here.

### API Endpoints (if applicable)

No new API endpoints required for this task.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Core functionality implemented and working as described
- [ ] All tests passing (unit, integration, e2e where applicable)
- [ ] Code follows project conventions and passes linting
- [ ] Documentation updated (code comments, README, API docs)
- [ ] Security considerations addressed (RLS, input validation, etc.)
- [ ] Performance requirements met (response times, resource usage)
- [ ] Error handling implemented with clear error messages
- [ ] Changes reviewed and approved by team
- [ ] No breaking changes to existing functionality
- [ ] Database migrations created if schema changes made
- [ ] Manual testing completed in development environment

**Definition of Done:**
- Code merged to main branch
- All CI/CD checks passing
- Documentation complete and accurate
- Ready for deployment to production

## Dependencies

### Technical Dependencies

- Existing codebase components
- Database schema (see schema.sql)
- External services: Supabase (Postgres, Realtime, Storage)

### Prerequisite Tasks

- Previous phase tasks completed
- Dependencies installed and configured
- Development environment ready
- Access to required services (Supabase, etc.)

## Implementation Notes

### Development Guidelines

1. Follow ESM module system (Node.js 20+)
2. Use modern JavaScript (ES2024+) features
3. Implement comprehensive error handling
4. Write tests before implementation (TDD)
5. Ensure code passes ESLint and Prettier checks

### Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests:** Test individual functions and modules
- **Integration Tests:** Test component interactions
- **E2E Tests:** Test complete user workflows (where applicable)

### Security Considerations

- RLS by `project_id`.
- Secrets AES-GCM with KEK rotation.
- Audit log for admin actions & secret access.
- PII redaction rules.

### Monitoring & Observability

- Add appropriate logging for debugging
- Track key metrics (response times, error rates)
- Set up alerts for critical failures
- Use Supabase Realtime for live updates where needed
