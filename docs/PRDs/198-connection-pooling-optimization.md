# PRD: Connection Pooling Optimization

## Overview

In the context of MeshHook, a webhook-first, deterministic, Postgres-native workflow engine, optimizing connection pooling is crucial for maintaining performance, reliability, and scalability. This task focuses on enhancing the existing connection pooling mechanism to ensure efficient database connection management, which is essential for handling high concurrency and throughput in a multi-tenant environment.

### Purpose

The main purpose of this task is to optimize the connection pooling strategy to reduce connection overhead, improve response times, and ensure stable and reliable database interactions under varying loads. This aligns with MeshHook's goals of delivering high performance and reliability without restrictive licensing.

### Alignment with Project Goals

- **Performance:** Reducing connection overhead directly impacts the response times of user-facing operations, maintaining the sub-second performance goal.
- **Reliability:** Efficient connection pooling contributes to system stability and uptime, supporting the 99.9% uptime objective.
- **Scalability:** Optimized connection management is key to scaling operations seamlessly as the number of tenants and workflows grows.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

1. **Optimize Database Connections:** Implement an optimized connection pooling strategy that dynamically adjusts to the workload.
2. **Configuration and Tuning:** Allow configuration of pool size, connection timeouts, and other relevant parameters.
3. **Monitoring and Metrics:** Integrate connection pool metrics (e.g., pool size, active/idle connections) for monitoring and alerting.
4. **Multi-Tenancy Support:** Ensure the connection pooling strategy supports multi-tenant RLS security without compromising isolation.
5. **Documentation:** Update the technical documentation to reflect the new connection pooling configuration options and best practices.

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** Ensure that the optimized connection pooling maintains or improves current response times for user-facing operations.
- **Reliability:** Achieve 99.9% uptime, with efficient management of database connections under peak loads.
- **Security:** Adhere to the project's security guidelines, ensuring that connection pooling does not introduce new vulnerabilities.
- **Maintainability:** Implement the solution in a way that follows project conventions and is easy to maintain and extend.

## Technical Specifications

### Architecture Context

MeshHook utilizes Supabase (Postgres) as its primary data storage, which includes data for workflows, runs, and logs. The connection pooling optimization must integrate seamlessly with the current stack, including SvelteKit for SSR/API and Supabase for backend services.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Analysis:** Examine the current database connection usage patterns and identify bottlenecks or inefficiencies.
2. **Design:** Propose a connection pooling design that addresses the identified issues, considering dynamic scaling, tenant isolation, and configuration flexibility.
3. **Implementation:** Integrate the chosen connection pooling library or mechanism, applying best practices for Postgres and Node.js environments.
4. **Testing:** Validate the new strategy under simulated load conditions to ensure performance gains and stability.
5. **Monitoring:** Implement monitoring for the new connection pool metrics, setting up alerts based on threshold breaches.

### Data Model

No changes to the data model are required for this task. However, monitoring metrics may be temporarily stored if needed for analysis.

### API Endpoints

No new API endpoints are required for this task.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Connection pooling strategy implemented and documented.
- [ ] Configuration parameters exposed and documented for tuning.
- [ ] Performance tests show improvement or maintenance of response times under load.
- [ ] System maintains stability and reliability under simulated peak loads.
- [ ] Monitoring and metrics for connection pooling are integrated and operational.
- [ ] Code review completed and changes merged to the main branch.

## Dependencies

### Technical Dependencies

- Supabase (Postgres)
- Existing codebase and architecture patterns
- Connection pooling library or mechanism compatible with Node.js and Postgres

### Prerequisite Tasks

- Review of current database connection management and performance metrics
- Selection of a connection pooling library or mechanism for implementation

## Implementation Notes

### Development Guidelines

- Follow the existing code structure and modular design patterns.
- Ensure all new code is covered by unit and integration tests.
- Document configuration options and their recommended settings.

### Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests:** Cover new configurations and their effects on connection pooling behavior.
- **Integration Tests:** Test the application's behavior under various simulated load conditions to ensure the connection pooling performs as expected.
- **Load Tests:** Simulate high traffic and workflows to validate performance improvements and system stability.

### Security Considerations

- Verify that the connection pooling strategy does not introduce any new attack vectors, especially in the context of multi-tenancy.
- Ensure that sensitive information (e.g., database credentials) is securely managed and not exposed.

### Monitoring & Observability

- Implement monitoring for key connection pool metrics, including pool size, active/idle connections, and wait times.
- Set up alerts for critical thresholds to proactively manage system health and performance.

By following these guidelines and requirements, the connection pooling optimization task will enhance MeshHook's performance, reliability, and scalability, contributing to a superior user experience and system stability.
