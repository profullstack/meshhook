# PRD: Connection Pooling Optimization

## Overview

<<<<<<< HEAD
In the context of MeshHook, a webhook-first, deterministic, Postgres-native workflow engine, optimizing connection pooling is crucial for maintaining performance, reliability, and scalability. This task focuses on enhancing the existing connection pooling mechanism to ensure efficient database connection management, which is essential for handling high concurrency and throughput in a multi-tenant environment.

### Purpose

The main purpose of this task is to optimize the connection pooling strategy to reduce connection overhead, improve response times, and ensure stable and reliable database interactions under varying loads. This aligns with MeshHook's goals of delivering high performance and reliability without restrictive licensing.

### Alignment with Project Goals

- **Performance:** Reducing connection overhead directly impacts the response times of user-facing operations, maintaining the sub-second performance goal.
- **Reliability:** Efficient connection pooling contributes to system stability and uptime, supporting the 99.9% uptime objective.
- **Scalability:** Optimized connection management is key to scaling operations seamlessly as the number of tenants and workflows grows.
=======
In the Deployment & Operations phase of MeshHook, a critical task is to optimize the connection pooling mechanism. This optimization is aimed at enhancing the efficiency and scalability of the system by improving how database connections are managed. Given MeshHook's architecture, which heavily relies on Postgres for workflow runs, event sourcing, and multi-tenant security, efficient connection pooling is vital for ensuring high performance and reliability under varying loads.

**Objective:** To optimize the connection pooling in MeshHook to achieve improved performance, scalability, and reliability.

**Alignment with Project Goals:**
- Enhances webhook triggers' responsiveness and reliability.
- Supports the durability of runs via event sourcing by ensuring database interactions are efficient and scalable.
- Contributes to the overall performance and reliability goals of MeshHook.

## Technical Specifications

### Architecture Context

<<<<<<< HEAD
MeshHook utilizes Supabase (Postgres) as its primary data storage, which includes data for workflows, runs, and logs. The connection pooling optimization must integrate seamlessly with the current stack, including SvelteKit for SSR/API and Supabase for backend services.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Analysis:** Examine the current database connection usage patterns and identify bottlenecks or inefficiencies.
2. **Design:** Propose a connection pooling design that addresses the identified issues, considering dynamic scaling, tenant isolation, and configuration flexibility.
3. **Implementation:** Integrate the chosen connection pooling library or mechanism, applying best practices for Postgres and Node.js environments.
4. **Testing:** Validate the new strategy under simulated load conditions to ensure performance gains and stability.
5. **Monitoring:** Implement monitoring for the new connection pool metrics, setting up alerts based on threshold breaches.

### Data Model

No changes to the data model are required for this task. However, monitoring metrics may be temporarily stored if needed for analysis.

### API Endpoints

No new API endpoints are required for this task.
