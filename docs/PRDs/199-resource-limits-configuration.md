# PRD: Resource Limits Configuration

## Overview

<<<<<<< HEAD
This PRD outlines the implementation strategy for configurable resource limits within MeshHook, addressing **Issue #199**. This feature is crucial for Phase 9: Deployment & Operations, focusing on production readiness by enabling administrators to set and manage resource usage limits to ensure system stability, performance, and cost control. By aligning with MeshHook's goals, this task supports maintaining the system's reliability, performance, and multi-tenant security through effective resource management.

## Objectives

- Ensure MeshHook's components operate within predefined resource constraints to avoid system overloads and ensure equitable resource distribution across tenants.
- Provide a flexible mechanism for configuring resource limits, supporting different environments and usage scenarios.
- Align with MeshHook's commitment to performance, reliability, and security.

## Functional Requirements

1. **Configuration Interface**: Implement a user-friendly interface within the MeshHook administration settings for defining resource limits.
2. **Resource Limits Scopes**:
   - Execution Time: Maximum allowed time for workflow execution.
   - Memory Usage: Maximum memory allocation per workflow execution.
   - Storage: Maximum storage space per tenant.
   - Concurrent Executions: Maximum number of concurrent workflow executions per tenant.
3. **Default and Custom Limits**: Establish sensible default limits while allowing customization per tenant or project.
4. **Enforcement Mechanism**: Develop a system to monitor and enforce the defined resource limits, including termination of executions exceeding limits.
5. **Notifications**: Implement notification mechanisms to alert administrators and users when limits are approached or exceeded.

## Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance**: The resource limits configuration and enforcement mechanisms must operate with minimal overhead to avoid impacting workflow execution performance.
- **Reliability**: The system should gracefully handle scenarios where resource limits are reached, ensuring reliable operation under all conditions.
- **Security**: Ensure that resource limit configurations are securely managed and cannot be bypassed by end-users or tenants.
- **Maintainability**: Implement the feature with clear, well-documented code and ensure it does not introduce significant complexity to the system.
=======
This task involves the configuration of resource limits within the MeshHook project, a crucial step towards ensuring our system's stability and scalability in production environments. By implementing configurable resource limits, MeshHook will be able to manage system resources effectively, prevent individual tenants from monopolizing shared resources, and maintain optimal performance levels across multi-tenant environments. This feature aligns with MeshHook's core objectives by enhancing the system's reliability, performance, and security, thereby ensuring a seamless and efficient workflow automation experience for all users.

## Functional Requirements

1. **Resource Limit Configuration:**
   - Implement a flexible configuration system to set and adjust resource limits for key system components, including but not limited to webhook processing, workflow executions, live log streaming, and database connections.
   
2. **Tenant-Specific Limits:**
   - Enable the configuration of resource limits on a per-tenant basis, allowing for customized allocation based on the specific needs and agreements with each tenant.

3. **Resource Usage Monitoring:**
   - Integrate resource usage monitoring capabilities to track the consumption of resources against the configured limits in real-time.

4. **Limit Enforcement:**
   - Develop mechanisms to enforce the configured resource limits, ensuring that operations are throttled or paused when limits are reached to prevent system overload.

5. **Notification System:**
   - Implement a notification system to alert administrators and/or tenants when resource usage approaches or exceeds configured limits.

6. **Documentation:**
   - Provide comprehensive documentation on how to configure resource limits, monitor resource usage, and handle limit breaches.

## Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** Ensure that the resource limit configuration and enforcement mechanisms do not introduce significant overhead or latency in system operations.
- **Reliability:** Design the system to gracefully handle situations where resource limits are reached, ensuring that critical operations can continue without disruption.
- **Security:** Ensure that the resource limit settings cannot be tampered with by unauthorized users, adhering to MeshHook's security standards.
- **Maintainability:** Write clean, modular code with clear documentation, making future adjustments to resource limits straightforward for developers.

## Technical Specifications

### Architecture Context

<<<<<<< HEAD
- Integrate with existing **SvelteKit (SSR/API)** components for configuration UI.
- Utilize **Supabase** for storing configuration settings and monitoring resource usage.
- Extend **Workers** (Orchestrator and HTTP Executor) to enforce execution time and memory usage limits.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Design Configuration UI**: Extend the administration settings in SvelteKit to include a section for resource limits configuration.
2. **Schema Extension**: Update `schema.sql` to include new tables or columns for storing resource limit configurations.
3. **Enforcement Mechanisms**:
   - Modify the Orchestrator and Executor components to check and enforce resource limits during workflow execution.
   - Implement a monitoring service to track and report resource usage against defined limits.
4. **Integration Testing**: Ensure the new functionality integrates seamlessly with existing components, particularly focusing on multi-tenant RLS security and performance metrics.
5. **Documentation**: Update technical documentation, API references, and user guides to reflect the new resource limits feature.

### Data Model Changes

- Add a new table `resource_limits` with columns for each resource limit type and foreign keys linking to the `tenants` or `projects` table.
- Update existing `workflows` and `executions` tables to include fields for tracking resource usage.
=======
The resource limits configuration feature will integrate with several components of the MeshHook architecture:

- **Supabase/Postgres:** For storing resource limit configurations and monitoring data.
- **SvelteKit (SSR/API):** For implementing administrative interfaces to configure and monitor resource limits.
- **Workers (Orchestrator, HTTP Executor):** To enforce resource limits during workflow execution and webhook processing.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Analysis:** Review the current architecture and identify the best points for integrating resource limit configurations and enforcement.
2. **Design:**
   - Define the schema for storing resource limit configurations in Postgres.
   - Design the API endpoints for configuring and monitoring resource limits.
   - Outline the mechanism for enforcing resource limits across different components.
3. **Implementation:**
   - Implement the database schema changes.
   - Develop the backend API for resource limit configuration and monitoring.
   - Integrate resource limit enforcement mechanisms in the workflow and webhook processing pipelines.
4. **Testing:** Conduct thorough testing, including unit, integration, and load testing, to ensure the feature works as expected and does not introduce regressions.
5. **Documentation:** Update the system documentation to include detailed guides on configuring and managing resource limits.
