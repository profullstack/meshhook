# PRD: Resource Limits Configuration

## Overview

This PRD outlines the implementation strategy for configurable resource limits within MeshHook, addressing **Issue #199**. This feature is crucial for Phase 9: Deployment & Operations, focusing on production readiness by enabling administrators to set and manage resource usage limits to ensure system stability, performance, and cost control. By aligning with MeshHook's goals, this task supports maintaining the system's reliability, performance, and multi-tenant security through effective resource management.

## Objectives

- Ensure MeshHook's components operate within predefined resource constraints to avoid system overloads and ensure equitable resource distribution across tenants.
- Provide a flexible mechanism for configuring resource limits, supporting different environments and usage scenarios.
- Align with MeshHook's commitment to performance, reliability, and security.

## Functional Requirements

1. **Configuration Interface**: Implement a user-friendly interface within the MeshHook administration settings for defining resource limits.
2. **Resource Limits Scopes**:
   - Execution Time: Maximum allowed time for workflow execution.
   - Memory Usage: Maximum memory allocation per workflow execution.
   - Storage: Maximum storage space per tenant.
   - Concurrent Executions: Maximum number of concurrent workflow executions per tenant.
3. **Default and Custom Limits**: Establish sensible default limits while allowing customization per tenant or project.
4. **Enforcement Mechanism**: Develop a system to monitor and enforce the defined resource limits, including termination of executions exceeding limits.
5. **Notifications**: Implement notification mechanisms to alert administrators and users when limits are approached or exceeded.

## Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance**: The resource limits configuration and enforcement mechanisms must operate with minimal overhead to avoid impacting workflow execution performance.
- **Reliability**: The system should gracefully handle scenarios where resource limits are reached, ensuring reliable operation under all conditions.
- **Security**: Ensure that resource limit configurations are securely managed and cannot be bypassed by end-users or tenants.
- **Maintainability**: Implement the feature with clear, well-documented code and ensure it does not introduce significant complexity to the system.

## Technical Specifications

### Architecture Context

- Integrate with existing **SvelteKit (SSR/API)** components for configuration UI.
- Utilize **Supabase** for storing configuration settings and monitoring resource usage.
- Extend **Workers** (Orchestrator and HTTP Executor) to enforce execution time and memory usage limits.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Design Configuration UI**: Extend the administration settings in SvelteKit to include a section for resource limits configuration.
2. **Schema Extension**: Update `schema.sql` to include new tables or columns for storing resource limit configurations.
3. **Enforcement Mechanisms**:
   - Modify the Orchestrator and Executor components to check and enforce resource limits during workflow execution.
   - Implement a monitoring service to track and report resource usage against defined limits.
4. **Integration Testing**: Ensure the new functionality integrates seamlessly with existing components, particularly focusing on multi-tenant RLS security and performance metrics.
5. **Documentation**: Update technical documentation, API references, and user guides to reflect the new resource limits feature.

### Data Model Changes

- Add a new table `resource_limits` with columns for each resource limit type and foreign keys linking to the `tenants` or `projects` table.
- Update existing `workflows` and `executions` tables to include fields for tracking resource usage.

### API Endpoints

- `POST /api/resource-limits`: Create or update resource limits.
- `GET /api/resource-limits/{tenantId}`: Retrieve resource limits for a tenant.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Administrators can configure resource limits via the MeshHook administration interface.
- [ ] Resource limits are enforced during workflow execution, with executions exceeding limits being terminated or throttled.
- [ ] Users and administrators are notified when resource usage approaches or exceeds limits.
- [ ] Documentation is updated to include guidance on configuring and managing resource limits.
- [ ] All new code is well-documented, adheres to project standards, and passes all tests.

## Dependencies

- Access to the existing MeshHook codebase and development environment.
- Supabase for data storage and possibly monitoring resource usage.

## Implementation Notes

### Development Guidelines

- Follow the existing coding standards and conventions used in MeshHook.
- Prioritize clear, maintainable code with comprehensive test coverage.

### Testing Strategy

- Implement unit tests for new functionality and integration tests to ensure resource limits interact correctly with existing features.
- Conduct performance testing to assess the impact of the resource limits enforcement mechanism on workflow execution.

### Security Considerations

- Implement robust authentication and authorization checks to ensure that only authorized users can configure resource limits.
- Validate all inputs to the resource limits configuration interface to prevent injection attacks.

### Monitoring & Observability

- Extend the existing monitoring setup to include metrics relevant to resource usage and limit enforcement, such as memory usage, execution time, and storage.
- Set up alerts for critical thresholds to ensure prompt administrative action.

By following this PRD, MeshHook will introduce a robust resource limits configuration feature, enhancing its production readiness and ability to scale securely and efficiently.
