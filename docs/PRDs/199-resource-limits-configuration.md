# PRD: Resource Limits Configuration

## Overview

This task involves the configuration of resource limits within the MeshHook project, a crucial step towards ensuring our system's stability and scalability in production environments. By implementing configurable resource limits, MeshHook will be able to manage system resources effectively, prevent individual tenants from monopolizing shared resources, and maintain optimal performance levels across multi-tenant environments. This feature aligns with MeshHook's core objectives by enhancing the system's reliability, performance, and security, thereby ensuring a seamless and efficient workflow automation experience for all users.

## Functional Requirements

1. **Resource Limit Configuration:**
   - Implement a flexible configuration system to set and adjust resource limits for key system components, including but not limited to webhook processing, workflow executions, live log streaming, and database connections.
   
2. **Tenant-Specific Limits:**
   - Enable the configuration of resource limits on a per-tenant basis, allowing for customized allocation based on the specific needs and agreements with each tenant.

3. **Resource Usage Monitoring:**
   - Integrate resource usage monitoring capabilities to track the consumption of resources against the configured limits in real-time.

4. **Limit Enforcement:**
   - Develop mechanisms to enforce the configured resource limits, ensuring that operations are throttled or paused when limits are reached to prevent system overload.

5. **Notification System:**
   - Implement a notification system to alert administrators and/or tenants when resource usage approaches or exceeds configured limits.

6. **Documentation:**
   - Provide comprehensive documentation on how to configure resource limits, monitor resource usage, and handle limit breaches.

## Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** Ensure that the resource limit configuration and enforcement mechanisms do not introduce significant overhead or latency in system operations.
- **Reliability:** Design the system to gracefully handle situations where resource limits are reached, ensuring that critical operations can continue without disruption.
- **Security:** Ensure that the resource limit settings cannot be tampered with by unauthorized users, adhering to MeshHook's security standards.
- **Maintainability:** Write clean, modular code with clear documentation, making future adjustments to resource limits straightforward for developers.

## Technical Specifications

### Architecture Context

The resource limits configuration feature will integrate with several components of the MeshHook architecture:

- **Supabase/Postgres:** For storing resource limit configurations and monitoring data.
- **SvelteKit (SSR/API):** For implementing administrative interfaces to configure and monitor resource limits.
- **Workers (Orchestrator, HTTP Executor):** To enforce resource limits during workflow execution and webhook processing.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Analysis:** Review the current architecture and identify the best points for integrating resource limit configurations and enforcement.
2. **Design:**
   - Define the schema for storing resource limit configurations in Postgres.
   - Design the API endpoints for configuring and monitoring resource limits.
   - Outline the mechanism for enforcing resource limits across different components.
3. **Implementation:**
   - Implement the database schema changes.
   - Develop the backend API for resource limit configuration and monitoring.
   - Integrate resource limit enforcement mechanisms in the workflow and webhook processing pipelines.
4. **Testing:** Conduct thorough testing, including unit, integration, and load testing, to ensure the feature works as expected and does not introduce regressions.
5. **Documentation:** Update the system documentation to include detailed guides on configuring and managing resource limits.

### Data Model

- Add a new table `resource_limits` to store resource limit configurations with columns for `tenant_id`, `resource_type`, `limit_value`, and `last_updated`.

### API Endpoints

- `POST /api/resource-limits`: Configure limits for a resource type.
- `GET /api/resource-limits/{tenant_id}`: Retrieve configured limits for a tenant.
- `GET /api/resource-usage/{tenant_id}`: Fetch current resource usage against limits for a tenant.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Resource limit configurations can be created, updated, and retrieved through the API.
- [ ] Resource usage is accurately tracked and compared against configured limits.
- [ ] The system enforces resource limits appropriately, with operations throttled or paused as configured.
- [ ] Notifications are triggered when resource usage approaches or exceeds limits.
- [ ] Documentation is complete and provides clear guidance on using the feature.
- [ ] All new code is well-tested and adheres to MeshHook's coding standards.

## Dependencies

- Supabase/Postgres for database changes.
- Access to the SvelteKit environment for API and frontend development.
- Coordination with the team responsible for the Workers component.

## Implementation Notes

### Development Guidelines

- Use TypeScript for type safety and better maintainability.
- Follow TDD practices by writing tests before implementing new features.
- Ensure new APIs are RESTful and use HTTP status codes appropriately.

### Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests:** For individual functions and methods related to resource limit configuration and enforcement.
- **Integration Tests:** To ensure the feature works end-to-end, from API requests to database updates and resource limit enforcement.
- **Load Tests:** Simulate high usage scenarios to verify that resource limits are enforced as expected without degrading system performance.

### Security Considerations

- Implement authentication and authorization checks for API endpoints related to resource limits.
- Store configuration data securely in Postgres, following MeshHook's encryption standards.

### Monitoring & Observability

- Integrate with Supabase Realtime for live monitoring of resource usage.
- Configure alerts based on resource usage metrics to proactively manage capacity and prevent system overloads.
