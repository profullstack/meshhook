# PRD: Node Reference Documentation

## 1. Overview

The MeshHook project is advancing into Phase 8, focusing on enriching user documentation. A critical component of this phase is the creation of node reference documentation, outlined in Issue #187. This documentation will serve as a foundational resource for developers, automation engineers, and indie builders, enabling them to leverage MeshHook's workflow engine more effectively. By providing detailed information on each node's purpose, configuration options, inputs, and outputs, we aim to facilitate the creation of complex, reliable workflows. This initiative directly supports MeshHook's goal of offering a robust, Postgres-native workflow engine that combines the visual simplicity of n8n and the durability of Temporal, without the constraints of restrictive licensing.

### Objective

To develop comprehensive, user-friendly node reference documentation that enhances the user's ability to implement MeshHook in their projects.

## 2. Functional Requirements

1. **Node Coverage**: Document every node offered by MeshHook, including but not limited to webhook triggers, transform nodes, HTTP calls, branches, delays, and termination nodes.
2. **Practical Examples**: For each node, provide examples that illustrate typical use cases and recommended configurations.
3. **Search Functionality**: Implement a search feature within the documentation to enable users to quickly locate information about specific nodes.
4. **Version Details**: Include version compatibility information for nodes, highlighting any version-dependent functionalities or constraints.

## 3. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Readability**: Ensure the documentation is written in clear, concise language and is organized in a manner that users find intuitive.
- **Update Facility**: Adopt a documentation format that can be easily updated to reflect additions or changes to nodes.
- **Accessibility Compliance**: Adhere to WCAG standards to make the documentation accessible to all users.

## 4. Technical Specifications

### Architecture Context

This documentation will be incorporated into MeshHook's existing documentation site, which is built with SvelteKit. If necessary, Supabase will be used for storing and managing the content of the documentation in a version-controlled manner.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Content Development**: Work closely with the MeshHook development team to compile comprehensive details on each node.
2. **Documentation Template Creation**: Develop a standardized template for documenting nodes to ensure consistency across the documentation.
3. **Writing Process**: Utilize Markdown for creating the documentation content, following the established template for each node.
4. **Review and Iteration**: Engage in technical reviews with the development team and usability testing with a target user group to refine the documentation.
5. **Documentation Integration**: Add the finalized documentation to the SvelteKit site, ensuring seamless navigation and search capabilities.

### Data Model Changes

- None required.

### API Endpoints

- None required.

## 5. Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Comprehensive documentation for each MeshHook node, including descriptions, configurations, inputs, outputs, and examples.
- [ ] Successful integration of the documentation into the SvelteKit site, with robust search functionality.
- [ ] Documentation completion and review within the defined timeline.
- [ ] Compliance with WCAG for accessibility.

## 6. Dependencies and Prerequisites

- Detailed information on current node implementations from the MeshHook development team.
- Access to the SvelteKit documentation site for integration purposes.

## 7. Implementation Notes

### Development Guidelines

- Prefer Markdown for all documentation to ensure broad compatibility and ease of updates.
- Adhere to the MeshHook documentation style guide to maintain a consistent user experience.

### Testing Strategy

- **Technical Review**: Conducted by the MeshHook development team to ensure accuracy.
- **Usability Testing**: Performed with a representative sample of the target user base to validate the documentation's effectiveness.

### Security Considerations

- Ensure that the documentation does not reveal any sensitive information about MeshHook's internal workings or security practices.

### Related Documentation

- MeshHook Main PRD, Architecture Overview, and Security Guidelines should be consulted to ensure alignment and consistency with existing project documentation.

This PRD sets the foundation for enhancing MeshHook's user documentation by providing clear, detailed, and accessible node references. By following this document, the project can significantly improve its usability and user support, aligning with MeshHook's overarching goals.
