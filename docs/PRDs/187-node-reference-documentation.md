# PRD: Node Reference Documentation

**Issue:** [#187](https://github.com/profullstack/meshhook/issues/187)  
**Milestone:** Phase 8: Documentation  
**Labels:** user-documentation, hacktoberfest  
**Phase:** Phase 8  
**Section:** User Documentation

---

## 1. Overview

The purpose of this task is to create comprehensive node reference documentation for MeshHook. This documentation is essential for enabling developers, automation engineers, and indie builders to fully utilize MeshHook's workflow engine capabilities. It aligns with the project's goal of delivering a webhook-first, deterministic, Postgres-native workflow engine by ensuring users have the necessary resources to implement complex workflows with ease and confidence.

**Objective:** Develop detailed, user-friendly node reference documentation that covers all available nodes within MeshHook, including their purposes, configurations, inputs, and outputs.

## 2. Functional Requirements

1. **Comprehensive Coverage:** Document each node available in MeshHook, including webhook triggers, transform nodes, HTTP calls, branches, delays, and termination nodes.
2. **Examples:** Provide practical examples for each node, demonstrating common use cases and configurations.
3. **Searchability:** Ensure the documentation is easily navigable and searchable, allowing users to find the information they need quickly.
4. **Version Compatibility:** Clearly indicate the version compatibility of nodes, highlighting any version-specific features or limitations.

## 3. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Usability:** Documentation should be clear, concise, and organized logically for easy consumption by the target audience.
- **Maintainability:** The documentation format must be easy to update as new nodes are added or existing nodes are modified.
- **Accessibility:** Ensure the documentation is accessible, following web content accessibility guidelines (WCAG).

## 4. Technical Specifications

### Architecture Context

The node reference documentation will be integrated into the existing SvelteKit-based documentation site, leveraging Supabase for storing and managing versioned documentation content if necessary.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Content Creation:** Collaborate with the development team to gather detailed information on each node, including configuration options, inputs, outputs, and use cases.
2. **Documentation Structure:** Design a template for node documentation to ensure consistency across the documentation. This template should include sections for description, configuration options, inputs, outputs, version compatibility, and examples.
3. **Authoring:** Write the documentation, adhering to the designed template for each node. Use Markdown for formatting to ensure compatibility with the SvelteKit documentation site.
4. **Review and Feedback:** Conduct technical reviews with the development team and usability reviews with a subset of the target audience. Incorporate feedback to improve clarity and completeness.
5. **Publication:** Integrate the documentation into the existing SvelteKit site, ensuring it is searchable and well-organized.

### Data Model Changes

No data model changes are required for this task.

### API Endpoints

No new API endpoints are required for this task.

## 5. Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Each node in MeshHook is documented, including description, configuration, inputs, outputs, and examples.
- [ ] Documentation is reviewed for technical accuracy and usability.
- [ ] Documentation is integrated into the SvelteKit site, easily searchable and navigable.
- [ ] Documentation adheres to web content accessibility guidelines (WCAG).

## 6. Dependencies and Prerequisites

- Access to MeshHook's current node implementations and developers for technical details.
- Existing SvelteKit-based documentation site for integration.

## 7. Implementation Notes

### Development Guidelines

- Use Markdown for documentation to ensure compatibility and ease of updates.
- Follow the established style guide for MeshHook documentation to maintain consistency.

### Testing Strategy

- **Technical Accuracy:** Review by the MeshHook development team.
- **Usability Testing:** Gather feedback from a small group of target users to ensure the documentation meets their needs.

### Security Considerations

As this task involves documentation, the primary security consideration is ensuring that no sensitive information about the implementation details or security mechanisms is inadvertently disclosed.

### Monitoring and Observability

N/A for documentation tasks. However, user feedback mechanisms should be in place to monitor the effectiveness of the documentation and identify areas for improvement.
