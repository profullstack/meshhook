# PRD: Database Performance Monitoring

**Issue:** [#202](https://github.com/profullstack/meshhook/issues/202)  
**Milestone:** Phase 9: Deployment & Operations  
**Labels:** monitoring, hacktoberfest  
**Phase:** Phase 9  
**Section:** Monitoring  

## Overview

In the context of MeshHook, a webhook-first, deterministic, Postgres-native workflow engine, the database is the backbone of the system, storing workflow definitions, run states, events, and more. Therefore, monitoring the performance of the Postgres database becomes critical to ensuring the overall health, responsiveness, and reliability of the MeshHook platform. This task aims to implement a comprehensive database performance monitoring system that aligns with MeshHook's core goals, including durability, security, and multi-tenancy, while maintaining the system's high performance and reliability standards.

### Objective

Implement a system for monitoring the performance of the MeshHook Postgres database, including query performance, index usage, connection health, and error rates, with the capability to alert on critical issues.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

1. **Monitoring Integration:** Leverage Supabase's built-in Postgres monitoring tools or integrate with an external monitoring solution like pganalyze or New Relic.
2. **Performance Metrics:** Track key database performance metrics such as query response times, index hit rates, table bloat, connection counts, and error rates.
3. **Alert System:** Implement an alert system for critical performance issues that could impact user experience or system reliability.
4. **Diagnostic Data:** Collect and store diagnostic data for analysis and troubleshooting of performance issues.
5. **Multi-Tenancy Support:** Ensure monitoring tools respect MeshHook's multi-tenant RLS security model, without exposing sensitive tenant data.

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** Monitoring should have minimal impact on database performance.
- **Reliability:** The monitoring system should be highly available and resilient against failures.
- **Security:** Adhere to MeshHook's security model, ensuring that monitoring access is restricted and data is protected.
- **Maintainability:** System should be easy to update and maintain, with clear documentation for future enhancements or modifications.

## Technical Specifications

### Architecture Context

- **Supabase:** Currently used for Postgres, Realtime, Storage, and Edge. Explore Supabase's monitoring capabilities or evaluate integration with external tools like pganalyze.
- **Monitoring Tools:** Evaluate tools based on ease of integration with Supabase/Postgres, feature set, and alignment with MeshHook's security and performance requirements.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Evaluation:** Research and select a monitoring solution that fits MeshHook's technical stack and requirements.
2. **Integration:** Implement the monitoring tool, ensuring it can access necessary database metrics without compromising security.
3. **Metric Selection:** Define key performance metrics to be monitored, setting thresholds for alerts based on historical performance data and expected usage patterns.
4. **Alert Configuration:** Configure alerts for critical thresholds, determining the best channels for notification (e.g., email, Slack).
5. **Testing:** Test the monitoring and alert system to ensure it accurately reflects database performance and reliably notifies of issues.
6. **Documentation:** Document the monitoring setup, including metrics tracked, alert thresholds, and response procedures for triggered alerts.

### Data Model

No direct changes to the data model for monitoring implementation. However, ensure any configuration or diagnostic data stored respects the existing schema and security model.

### API Endpoints

No new API endpoints required specifically for database performance monitoring.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Selected monitoring tool is fully integrated with MeshHook's Postgres database.
- [ ] Key performance metrics are being tracked and logged.
- [ ] Alert system is configured to notify on critical performance issues.
- [ ] Monitoring system respects MeshHook's multi-tenant security model.
- [ ] Performance impact of monitoring on the database is within acceptable limits.
- [ ] Documentation for the monitoring system is complete and accessible to the team.

## Dependencies

- Access to MeshHook's Supabase dashboard and/or database for monitoring setup.
- Potential need for external monitoring tool subscriptions or accounts.

## Implementation Notes

### Development Guidelines

- Ensure any third-party tool integrations follow secure access practices, using API keys or tokens stored securely.
- Follow existing code and documentation standards for any scripts or configuration code developed.

### Testing Strategy

- Perform load testing to simulate high traffic and ensure the monitoring system accurately reflects performance under stress.
- Test alert system with simulated performance threshold breaches.

### Security Considerations

- Ensure monitoring access is tightly controlled, with audit logs for access to performance data.
- Review and follow Supabase and/or third-party tool security best practices for monitoring setups.

### Monitoring & Observability

- Incorporate database performance metrics into MeshHook's existing observability dashboards if possible.
- Regularly review performance metrics and adjust thresholds and alerts as necessary based on system growth and usage patterns.
