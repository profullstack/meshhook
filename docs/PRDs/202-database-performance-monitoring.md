# PRD: Database Performance Monitoring

**Issue:** [#202](https://github.com/profullstack/meshhook/issues/202)  
**Milestone:** Phase 9: Deployment & Operations  
**Labels:** monitoring  
**Phase:** Phase 9  
**Section:** Monitoring

---

## Overview

As MeshHook scales to support more complex workflows and a growing number of users, ensuring the performance and reliability of our Postgres database becomes paramount. Database performance monitoring is crucial for identifying slow queries, bottlenecks, and potential scalability issues before they impact our users. This task aims to integrate comprehensive database performance monitoring tools and practices into our existing infrastructure, aligning with MeshHook's goals of reliability, performance, and security.

### Objectives

- Integrate a database performance monitoring solution that provides real-time analytics, historical data, and alerts.
- Identify and resolve potential performance bottlenecks.
- Ensure the scalability and reliability of MeshHook's database.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

1. **Monitoring Integration:** Integrate a database monitoring tool that supports Postgres and offers detailed insights into query performance, lock waits, indexing suggestions, and overall database health.
2. **Alerting Mechanism:** Implement an alerting mechanism for critical performance metrics thresholds (e.g., long-running queries, high CPU/memory usage).
3. **Performance Dashboard:** Develop a performance dashboard accessible by the MeshHook admin team, featuring real-time and historical data.
4. **Documentation:** Provide comprehensive documentation on monitoring setup, key metrics, and troubleshooting performance issues.

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** Ensure minimal performance overhead from monitoring tools on the database operations.
- **Reliability:** Guarantee 99.9% uptime for the monitoring system, with failover strategies for critical components.
- **Security:** Ensure all monitoring data is encrypted in transit and at rest. Access to performance data should be restricted to authorized personnel only.

## Technical Specifications

### Architecture Context

MeshHook utilizes a Postgres-native architecture, with Supabase as a core component for data storage, queues, and real-time log streaming. The database performance monitoring solution must integrate seamlessly with this existing setup, leveraging and enhancing our current tools where possible.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Evaluation:** Assess available database performance monitoring tools that integrate well with Postgres and Supabase, considering factors such as feature set, security, overhead, and cost.
2. **Tool Selection:** Choose a monitoring tool based on the evaluation criteria. Prefer open-source solutions for community support and extensibility.
3. **Integration:** Implement the monitoring tool within our infrastructure, ensuring compatibility with Supabase and minimal impact on existing operations.
4. **Dashboard Development:** Utilize the selected tool's API or data export capabilities to develop a custom performance dashboard tailored to MeshHook's needs.
5. **Alerting Setup:** Configure alerts based on critical performance metrics, ensuring notifications are delivered to the admin team through preferred channels (e.g., email, Slack).
6. **Documentation and Training:** Document the setup process, key metrics, and troubleshooting guidelines. Provide training for the admin team on using the monitoring tools and dashboard.
7. **Testing and Optimization:** Test the monitoring and alerting system under various load conditions. Optimize alert thresholds and dashboard metrics based on real-world data.

### Data Model

No changes to the existing data model are required for this task. Monitoring data should be stored externally and not impact the operational database schema.

### API Endpoints

N/A - This task focuses on internal monitoring tools and does not expose new API endpoints.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Selected database performance monitoring tool is fully integrated with MeshHook's infrastructure.
- [ ] Performance dashboard is accessible by the admin team, displaying real-time and historical data.
- [ ] Alerting mechanism for critical performance metrics is operational.
- [ ] Documentation for the monitoring setup, key metrics, and troubleshooting is complete.
- [ ] Admin team has received training on the monitoring tools and dashboard.
- [ ] Performance monitoring introduces negligible overhead on database operations.

## Dependencies

- Access to MeshHook's Supabase account and infrastructure.
- Approval of tooling and budget for any non-open-source solutions.

## Implementation Notes

### Development Guidelines

- Prioritize open-source tools with active community support.
- Ensure all third-party integrations comply with MeshHook's security guidelines.
- Follow MeshHook's existing coding and documentation standards.

### Testing Strategy

- Simulate high-load conditions to validate the accuracy and responsiveness of the monitoring tools.
- Test the alerting mechanism under various scenarios to ensure reliability.

### Security Considerations

- Monitor access control to the performance dashboard and data.
- Ensure encryption for all monitoring data in transit and at rest.

### Monitoring & Observability

- Utilize the integrated monitoring tool for MeshHook's database performance.
- Set up key metrics tracking and alerts for proactive issue resolution.
