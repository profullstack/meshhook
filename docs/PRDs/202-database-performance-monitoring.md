# PRD: Database Performance Monitoring

---

## Overview

The objective of integrating database performance monitoring into MeshHook's architecture is to ensure optimal performance, reliability, and scalability of the PostgreSQL database underlying our webhook-first, deterministic, Postgres-native workflow engine. This initiative is critical as MeshHook scales up, supporting more complex workflows and a growing user base. Effective performance monitoring will allow us to proactively identify and mitigate potential database bottlenecks, ensuring a seamless experience for our users.

### Objectives

- Implement a robust database performance monitoring system.
- Enable real-time analytics, historical performance data analysis, and proactive alerting for performance anomalies.
- Minimize the performance overhead introduced by monitoring activities.
- Maintain the security and integrity of monitoring data.

## Functional Requirements

1. **Monitoring Tool Integration:** The system must support integration with a Postgres-compatible monitoring tool that provides insights into query performance, indexing, lock waits, and general health metrics.
2. **Alerting System:** An alerting system must be implemented to notify the MeshHook admin team of critical performance issues, based on predefined thresholds.
3. **Performance Dashboard:** A dashboard accessible to the MeshHook admin team must be developed, showcasing real-time and historical database performance metrics.
4. **Comprehensive Documentation:** Detailed documentation on the setup, configuration, and usage of the monitoring system, including troubleshooting performance issues, must be provided.

## Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** The monitoring system must introduce minimal overhead to database operations, ensuring that performance remains unaffected.
- **Reliability:** The monitoring system must guarantee high availability, with a target of 99.9% uptime, and include failover mechanisms for critical components.
- **Security:** Monitoring data must be encrypted in transit and at rest, with strict access controls to ensure that only authorized personnel can view sensitive information.

## Technical Specifications

### Architecture Context

MeshHook utilizes a robust Postgres-native architecture, augmented by Supabase for data storage, queuing, and real-time log streaming. The performance monitoring solution must seamlessly integrate into this existing infrastructure, complementing and enhancing our current capabilities without disrupting operations.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Tool Evaluation:** Assess potential database performance monitoring tools for compatibility with Postgres and Supabase, considering features, security, overhead, and cost.
2. **Selection:** Choose a monitoring tool based on the evaluation, with a preference for open-source solutions to benefit from community support and ensure extensibility.
3. **Integration:** Seamlessly integrate the selected tool with MeshHook’s infrastructure, ensuring minimal impact on performance and operations.
4. **Dashboard Development:** Develop a custom dashboard using the tool's API or data export features, tailored to the needs of the MeshHook admin team.
5. **Alerting Configuration:** Set up an alerting mechanism based on critical performance metrics, with notifications delivered via preferred channels (e.g., email, Slack).
6. **Documentation & Training:** Create comprehensive documentation and provide training to the admin team on monitoring tool usage and the performance dashboard.
7. **Testing & Optimization:** Conduct tests under various load conditions to validate the monitoring system's effectiveness and optimize alert thresholds based on real-world data.

### Data Model

No direct changes to the MeshHook operational data model are required. Monitoring data will be managed externally to avoid impacting the primary database schema.

### API Endpoints

N/A - This initiative focuses on internal tools and processes without introducing new external API endpoints.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Integration of the selected database performance monitoring tool with MeshHook’s infrastructure is complete.
- [ ] A performance dashboard displaying real-time and historical data is accessible to the admin team.
- [ ] The alerting mechanism for critical performance metrics is operational and tested.
- [ ] Comprehensive documentation for the monitoring setup, key metrics, and troubleshooting is provided.
- [ ] The admin team has been trained on monitoring tool usage and dashboard navigation.
- [ ] The monitoring system introduces negligible overhead on database performance.

## Dependencies

- Access to MeshHook's existing Supabase infrastructure.
- Budget and approval for any tools or services requiring financial investment.

## Implementation Notes

### Development Guidelines

- Favor open-source monitoring tools with robust community support.
- Ensure compatibility with MeshHook’s security policies for all third-party integrations.
- Adhere to MeshHook’s coding, documentation, and architectural standards throughout the implementation.

### Testing Strategy

- Conduct stress tests to validate the monitoring system's accuracy and responsiveness under high-load scenarios.
- Test the alerting mechanism under a variety of conditions to ensure reliability and effectiveness.

### Security Considerations

- Implement strict access controls for the performance dashboard and monitoring data.
- Ensure all data is encrypted in transit and at rest, adhering to MeshHook’s security guidelines.

### Monitoring & Observability

- Leverage the new database performance monitoring solution for ongoing observation and analysis of MeshHook's database operations.
- Establish key performance metrics and set up alerts for proactive issue identification and resolution.

By adhering to these guidelines and requirements, MeshHook will establish a comprehensive database performance monitoring system that ensures the platform remains performant, reliable, and scalable as it grows.
