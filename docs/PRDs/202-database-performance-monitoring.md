# PRD: Database Performance Monitoring

**Issue:** [#202](https://github.com/profullstack/meshhook/issues/202)  
**Milestone:** Phase 9: Deployment & Operations  
**Labels:** monitoring, hacktoberfest  
**Phase:** Phase 9  
**Section:** Monitoring  

## Overview

<<<<<<< HEAD
As MeshHook scales to support more complex workflows and a growing number of users, ensuring the performance and reliability of our Postgres database becomes paramount. Database performance monitoring is crucial for identifying slow queries, bottlenecks, and potential scalability issues before they impact our users. This task aims to integrate comprehensive database performance monitoring tools and practices into our existing infrastructure, aligning with MeshHook's goals of reliability, performance, and security.

### Objectives

- Integrate a database performance monitoring solution that provides real-time analytics, historical data, and alerts.
- Identify and resolve potential performance bottlenecks.
- Ensure the scalability and reliability of MeshHook's database.
=======
In the context of MeshHook, a webhook-first, deterministic, Postgres-native workflow engine, the database is the backbone of the system, storing workflow definitions, run states, events, and more. Therefore, monitoring the performance of the Postgres database becomes critical to ensuring the overall health, responsiveness, and reliability of the MeshHook platform. This task aims to implement a comprehensive database performance monitoring system that aligns with MeshHook's core goals, including durability, security, and multi-tenancy, while maintaining the system's high performance and reliability standards.

### Objective

Implement a system for monitoring the performance of the MeshHook Postgres database, including query performance, index usage, connection health, and error rates, with the capability to alert on critical issues.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

<<<<<<< HEAD
1. **Monitoring Integration:** Integrate a database monitoring tool that supports Postgres and offers detailed insights into query performance, lock waits, indexing suggestions, and overall database health.
2. **Alerting Mechanism:** Implement an alerting mechanism for critical performance metrics thresholds (e.g., long-running queries, high CPU/memory usage).
3. **Performance Dashboard:** Develop a performance dashboard accessible by the MeshHook admin team, featuring real-time and historical data.
4. **Documentation:** Provide comprehensive documentation on monitoring setup, key metrics, and troubleshooting performance issues.

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** Ensure minimal performance overhead from monitoring tools on the database operations.
- **Reliability:** Guarantee 99.9% uptime for the monitoring system, with failover strategies for critical components.
- **Security:** Ensure all monitoring data is encrypted in transit and at rest. Access to performance data should be restricted to authorized personnel only.
=======
1. **Monitoring Integration:** Leverage Supabase's built-in Postgres monitoring tools or integrate with an external monitoring solution like pganalyze or New Relic.
2. **Performance Metrics:** Track key database performance metrics such as query response times, index hit rates, table bloat, connection counts, and error rates.
3. **Alert System:** Implement an alert system for critical performance issues that could impact user experience or system reliability.
4. **Diagnostic Data:** Collect and store diagnostic data for analysis and troubleshooting of performance issues.
5. **Multi-Tenancy Support:** Ensure monitoring tools respect MeshHook's multi-tenant RLS security model, without exposing sensitive tenant data.

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** Monitoring should have minimal impact on database performance.
- **Reliability:** The monitoring system should be highly available and resilient against failures.
- **Security:** Adhere to MeshHook's security model, ensuring that monitoring access is restricted and data is protected.
- **Maintainability:** System should be easy to update and maintain, with clear documentation for future enhancements or modifications.

## Technical Specifications

### Architecture Context

<<<<<<< HEAD
MeshHook utilizes a Postgres-native architecture, with Supabase as a core component for data storage, queues, and real-time log streaming. The database performance monitoring solution must integrate seamlessly with this existing setup, leveraging and enhancing our current tools where possible.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Evaluation:** Assess available database performance monitoring tools that integrate well with Postgres and Supabase, considering factors such as feature set, security, overhead, and cost.
2. **Tool Selection:** Choose a monitoring tool based on the evaluation criteria. Prefer open-source solutions for community support and extensibility.
3. **Integration:** Implement the monitoring tool within our infrastructure, ensuring compatibility with Supabase and minimal impact on existing operations.
4. **Dashboard Development:** Utilize the selected tool's API or data export capabilities to develop a custom performance dashboard tailored to MeshHook's needs.
5. **Alerting Setup:** Configure alerts based on critical performance metrics, ensuring notifications are delivered to the admin team through preferred channels (e.g., email, Slack).
6. **Documentation and Training:** Document the setup process, key metrics, and troubleshooting guidelines. Provide training for the admin team on using the monitoring tools and dashboard.
7. **Testing and Optimization:** Test the monitoring and alerting system under various load conditions. Optimize alert thresholds and dashboard metrics based on real-world data.

### Data Model

No changes to the existing data model are required for this task. Monitoring data should be stored externally and not impact the operational database schema.

### API Endpoints

N/A - This task focuses on internal monitoring tools and does not expose new API endpoints.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Selected database performance monitoring tool is fully integrated with MeshHook's infrastructure.
- [ ] Performance dashboard is accessible by the admin team, displaying real-time and historical data.
- [ ] Alerting mechanism for critical performance metrics is operational.
- [ ] Documentation for the monitoring setup, key metrics, and troubleshooting is complete.
- [ ] Admin team has received training on the monitoring tools and dashboard.
- [ ] Performance monitoring introduces negligible overhead on database operations.

## Dependencies

- Access to MeshHook's Supabase account and infrastructure.
- Approval of tooling and budget for any non-open-source solutions.
=======
- **Supabase:** Currently used for Postgres, Realtime, Storage, and Edge. Explore Supabase's monitoring capabilities or evaluate integration with external tools like pganalyze.
- **Monitoring Tools:** Evaluate tools based on ease of integration with Supabase/Postgres, feature set, and alignment with MeshHook's security and performance requirements.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Evaluation:** Research and select a monitoring solution that fits MeshHook's technical stack and requirements.
