# PRD: Supabase Client Setup

## Overview

The purpose of this task is to set up the Supabase client for the MeshHook project, under Phase 3: Frontend (SvelteKit). This setup is fundamental for integrating MeshHook's frontend with Supabase services, including Postgres databases, Realtime subscriptions, and Storage. By successfully implementing the Supabase client, MeshHook will leverage Supabase's capabilities to achieve real-time data updates, secure and scalable data storage, and efficient data retrieval mechanisms. This task aligns with MeshHook's goals by ensuring the application's backend services are seamlessly connected to the SvelteKit-based frontend, facilitating features such as live logs via Supabase Realtime and multi-tenant RLS security.

## Functional Requirements

1. **Supabase Client Initialization:** Implement and configure the Supabase client within the SvelteKit application to connect with the Supabase project.
2. **Environment Variable Configuration:** Securely manage Supabase credentials (URL and anon/public key) using environment variables.
3. **Realtime Subscriptions Setup:** Enable subscriptions for live updates from Supabase Realtime, ensuring that the frontend can receive and display updates without manual refresh.
4. **Database Querying:** Facilitate querying the Supabase Postgres database directly from the SvelteKit frontend where necessary, following best practices for security and efficiency.
5. **Storage Access:** Implement methods to interact with Supabase Storage for uploading, retrieving, and managing artifacts.
6. **Security Integration:** Ensure the setup respects Row-Level Security (RLS) policies defined in Supabase, securing multi-tenant access controls.

## Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** The Supabase client must handle requests efficiently, ensuring minimal latency in user interactions, particularly for live updates.
- **Reliability:** The client setup must include error handling to manage and recover from potential failures in communication with Supabase services.
- **Security:** Secure handling of API keys and user data, adhering to MeshHook's security guidelines, including RLS and secrets management.
- **Maintainability:** The implementation should be modular, well-documented, and easy to extend as MeshHook's requirements evolve.

## Technical Specifications

### Architecture Context

MeshHook uses SvelteKit for its frontend, with backend services including database, realtime updates, and storage handled by Supabase. The Supabase client setup is a critical bridge that connects these components, enabling dynamic, real-time web applications. This task will involve configuring the Supabase JavaScript client within the SvelteKit application, establishing patterns for its use throughout the project.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Analysis:** Review the current frontend architecture to determine the best integration points for the Supabase client.
2. **Environment Configuration:** Set up project environment variables for Supabase URL and keys, ensuring they are securely managed and not hard-coded.
3. **Client Initialization:** Implement a module for initializing the Supabase client with the environment variables, exporting the client for use across the frontend application.
4. **Realtime Subscriptions:** Create a utility function or Svelte store for managing Realtime subscriptions, ensuring components can subscribe and unsubscribe efficiently.
5. **Database and Storage Integration:** Develop functions or utilities for common database operations (CRUD) and interacting with Supabase Storage, adhering to security best practices.
6. **Testing and Validation:** Test the integration extensively, both in isolation and as part of the overall system, to ensure reliability and performance.
7. **Documentation:** Document the setup process, including code comments and updates to the project's README or developer documentation, detailing how to use the Supabase client within the SvelteKit application.

### Data Model

No changes to the data model are required for this task. However, developers should be familiar with the existing schema to effectively implement and use database operations.

### API Endpoints

No new API endpoints are being introduced in this task. This task focuses on the client-side integration with existing Supabase services.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Supabase client successfully initialized and configured with environment variables.
- [ ] Realtime updates from Supabase are accurately reflected in the frontend without manual refresh.
- [ ] Database queries and storage operations through the Supabase client are secure, efficient, and functional.
- [ ] Environment variables for Supabase credentials are managed securely and not exposed.
- [ ] Implementation is well-documented, with clear instructions for future developers on how to utilize the Supabase client in the frontend application.
- [ ] All functionality is tested and verified in a development environment.

## Dependencies

- Access to the MeshHook Supabase project and credentials.
- SvelteKit environment setup and understanding of the existing frontend codebase.

## Implementation Notes

### Development Guidelines

- Use async/await for handling asynchronous operations with the Supabase client.
- Modularize the Supabase client setup for reusability across the frontend application.
- Ensure all Supabase interactions adhere to security best practices, especially regarding RLS and sensitive data handling.

### Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests:** For functions and utilities interacting with the Supabase client.
- **Integration Tests:** To verify that frontend components correctly interact with Supabase services (e.g., Realtime updates and data fetching).
- **Manual Testing:** For end-to-end verification of the setup, especially focusing on live updates and multi-tenant security aspects.

### Security Considerations

- Ensure that Supabase credentials are securely stored and accessed through environment variables.
- Verify that RLS policies on Supabase are correctly enforced in all frontend data interactions.

### Monitoring & Observability

- Implement logging for critical steps in the Supabase client interaction, particularly for error handling.
- Where applicable, use Supabase's built-in monitoring tools to track usage and performance issues.

## Related Documentation

- Supabase JavaScript client documentation for detailed API usage and best practices.
- MeshHook's existing documentation on security guidelines, architecture, and the current frontend implementation setup.
