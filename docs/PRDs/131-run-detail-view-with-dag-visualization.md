## Overview

The **Run Detail View with DAG Visualization** task is a critical component of the MeshHook project's Phase 3 milestone, focusing on enhancing the Run Console section. This feature aims to provide users with a detailed view of individual workflow runs, represented through a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) visualization. This aligns with MeshHook's goal to deliver a visually intuitive and durable workflow engine that supports webhook triggers, visual DAG building, durable runs, live logging, and multi-tenant security.

### Objectives

- To visually represent the execution path of a workflow run within the MeshHook platform.
- To enhance the debugging and monitoring capabilities for users by providing detailed insights into the run's state, history, and performance.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

1. **DAG Visualization:** Generate and display a visual representation of the workflow execution as a DAG, showing the sequence and dependencies between nodes.
2. **Run Detail Information:** Display detailed information about the run, including start/end times, execution status, and any errors encountered.
3. **Live Updates:** Integrate with Supabase Realtime to reflect live status updates within the DAG visualization and run details.
4. **User Interaction:** Allow users to interact with the DAG nodes to view specific logs, metrics, or errors associated with each step.
5. **Navigation and Usability:** Provide an intuitive interface for navigating between different runs and workflows.

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** Ensure the DAG visualization and run detail fetching operations complete within sub-second response times.
- **Reliability:** Achieve 99.9% uptime for the run detail view feature.
- **Security:** Implement RLS and adhere to the existing project security guidelines to protect run data.
- **Maintainability:** Code should be clean, well-documented, and easy to maintain with adherence to the project's coding standards.

## Technical Specifications

### Architecture Context

MeshHook utilizes a combination of SvelteKit for frontend development, Supabase for backend services, and a PostgreSQL database. The run detail view with DAG visualization requires integration with these existing components:

- **SvelteKit/Svelte 5:** For building the frontend user interface.
- **Supabase Realtime:** To stream run status updates.
- **PostgreSQL:** To retrieve run details and workflow definitions.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Design Phase:** Create mockups for the DAG visualization and run detail view. Define the user interaction models and data flow.
2. **Data Modeling:** Identify necessary database queries to fetch run details and workflow definitions from PostgreSQL.
3. **Frontend Development:**
   - Implement the DAG visualization using a suitable JavaScript library that integrates well with Svelte.
   - Develop the run detail view component, fetching data from PostgreSQL through Supabase.
   - Ensure live updates using Supabase Realtime subscriptions.
4. **Integration Testing:** Test the integration of the new frontend components with the backend data sources.
5. **Performance Optimization:** Optimize the frontend components and database queries for performance.
6. **Security Review:** Ensure all data interactions are secured and comply with RLS policies.

### Data Model Changes

No immediate data model changes are required. However, any adjustments discovered during implementation should be documented and applied to `schema.sql`.

### API Endpoints

No new API endpoints are required. The existing endpoints for fetching run details and workflow definitions will be utilized.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] DAG visualization accurately represents the workflow execution path.
- [ ] Run details are correctly displayed, including execution status and errors.
- [ ] Live updates are reflected in real-time without manual page refreshes.
- [ ] User interactions with DAG nodes display relevant logs or metrics.
- [ ] Performance benchmarks for response time are met.
- [ ] Code adheres to project's coding standards and security guidelines.

## Dependencies

- SvelteKit and Supabase access and configurations must be in place.
- Access to the PostgreSQL database schema for potential adjustments.
- Existing frontend and backend codebase for integration.

## Implementation Notes

### Development Guidelines

- Utilize the latest features of SvelteKit and Svelte 5, following component best practices.
- Implement error handling and logging mechanisms.
- Prioritize user experience and interface responsiveness.

### Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests:** For individual components and utility functions.
- **Integration Tests:** To ensure components interact correctly with backend services.
- **E2E Tests:** Simulate user interactions and data flow through the application.

### Security Considerations

- Ensure all database queries are protected against SQL injection.
- Verify that RLS policies are correctly applied to all data queries.
- Audit log access and modifications to run details.

### Monitoring & Observability

- Instrument frontend components to track performance metrics.
- Monitor error rates and log anomalies for the new feature.
- Utilize Supabase Realtime monitoring tools to ensure live updates are functioning correctly.
