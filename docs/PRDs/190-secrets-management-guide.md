# PRD: Secrets Management Guide

## Overview

This PRD outlines the development of a comprehensive secrets management guide for MeshHook. The guide aims to provide clear, actionable instructions and best practices for securely handling secrets such as API keys, database credentials, and other sensitive information within the MeshHook platform. This initiative is in direct alignment with MeshHook's overarching goals of simplicity, durability, and security, ensuring that users can manage their workflows with confidence, particularly in regulated industries where data security is paramount.

## Functional Requirements

1. **Comprehensive Coverage**: The guide must cover all aspects of secrets management within MeshHook, including but not limited to, creating, updating, deleting, and accessing secrets.
   
2. **Clarity and Accessibility**: Steps for managing secrets should be clear and written in layman's terms to ensure accessibility for users of all technical levels.
   
3. **Best Practices and Security Emphasis**: Include a section dedicated to best practices for secrets management and emphasize the importance of adhering to these practices to ensure data security.
   
4. **Integration and Examples**: Provide examples of how secrets can be securely integrated into workflows, including code snippets or configuration examples where applicable.
   
5. **FAQs and Troubleshooting**: Address common questions and potential issues users may encounter while managing secrets, offering solutions and troubleshooting steps.

## Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance**: The documentation should be hosted on a platform that allows for quick and responsive access, ensuring users can retrieve information without significant load times.
  
- **Reliability**: The guide must be kept up to date with the latest features and practices related to secrets management in MeshHook to remain a reliable resource.
  
- **Security**: The approach to creating and managing the guide itself must prioritize security, ensuring no sensitive information is disclosed or compromised.
  
- **Maintainability**: Opt for a documentation format and platform that supports easy updates and edits, allowing the guide to evolve alongside MeshHook.

## Technical Specifications

### Architecture Context

MeshHook's architecture, leveraging SvelteKit for the frontend and Supabase, including Postgres, for backend services, requires a secure and efficient method for managing secrets. The guide will integrate with existing documentation, providing a seamless experience for users looking to understand or implement secrets management.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Research and Gather Content**: Review MeshHook's current features and capabilities around secrets management, compiling necessary content.
   
2. **Drafting**: Create an initial draft of the guide, organizing content into logical sections (Introduction, Steps for Managing Secrets, Best Practices, FAQs).
   
3. **Technical Review**: Submit the draft for technical review by the development team to ensure accuracy and completeness.
   
4. **Incorporate Feedback**: Update the guide based on feedback from the technical review and other stakeholders.
   
5. **Publishing**: Publish the guide on the MeshHook documentation platform, ensuring it is properly indexed and easy to find.

### Data Model and API Endpoints

No changes to the data model or new API endpoints are necessary for this task.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] The guide is published and accessible within the MeshHook documentation platform.
  
- [ ] All functional requirements are met, with clear, comprehensive coverage of secrets management practices.
  
- [ ] The guide adheres to non-functional requirements, ensuring performance, reliability, security, and maintainability.
  
- [ ] Feedback from the technical review has been incorporated, and the guide is approved by the MeshHook team.
  
- [ ] Users can easily find and navigate the guide, with positive initial feedback on its clarity and usefulness.

## Dependencies

## Implementation Notes

### Development Guidelines

- Use Markdown for documentation to ensure compatibility with the MeshHook documentation platform and ease of updates.
  
- Adhere to the existing style guide for MeshHook documentation to ensure consistency in presentation and terminology.

### Testing Strategy

- **Technical Review**: The guide should undergo a thorough technical review by the MeshHook development team.
  
- **User Feedback**: Solicit initial feedback from a select group of MeshHook users to gauge clarity, usefulness, and any areas needing improvement.

### Security Considerations

- Carefully review the guide to ensure it does not inadvertently disclose sensitive information or encourage insecure practices.
  
- Highlight the importance of following the outlined best practices for managing secrets within MeshHook workflows.

### Monitoring & Observability

- Implement tracking for access and usage of the secrets management guide to identify popular sections or areas where users may be encountering difficulties, allowing for targeted improvements.
