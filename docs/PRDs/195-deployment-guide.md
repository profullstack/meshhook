# PRD: Deployment Guide

## Overview

The deployment guide is a critical component of the MeshHook project's Phase 8: Developer Documentation. This guide's primary objective is to provide clear, concise, and comprehensive instructions for deploying MeshHook instances. It aligns with MeshHook's overarching goals by facilitating the deployment process for webhook triggers, visual DAG builders, durable runs, live logs, and multi-tenant RLS security features.

The deployment guide aims to ensure that users — from indie builders to platform teams — can deploy MeshHook with confidence, understanding the necessary steps and considerations for a secure, efficient, and reliable setup.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

1. **Comprehensive Coverage:** The guide must cover all aspects of deployment, including prerequisites, environment setup, configuration, scaling, and troubleshooting.
2. **Environment Specifics:** Provide instructions for various environments (cloud providers, Docker, Kubernetes).
3. **Configuration Best Practices:** Outline best practices for configuring MeshHook, focusing on security, performance, and reliability.
4. **Update and Rollback:** Instructions for updating MeshHook instances and rolling back in case of issues.
5. **Tooling and Scripts:** Include any recommended tooling or scripts that facilitate deployment, where applicable.

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **Usability:** The guide should be easy to follow for users with varying levels of expertise.
- **Accuracy:** All instructions must be verified for correctness and clarity.
- **Maintainability:** The guide should be structured in a way that it's easy to update as MeshHook evolves.

## Technical Specifications

### Architecture Context

MeshHook leverages a combination of SvelteKit (for SSR/API), Supabase (for database and real-time operations), and distributed workers. The deployment architecture must consider these components, ensuring they are correctly configured and secured.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Gather Requirements:** Detail the technical and infrastructure requirements for running MeshHook.
2. **Environment Setup:** Instructions for setting up various environments, including cloud services (AWS, GCP, Azure), Docker, and Kubernetes.
3. **Configuration:** Guidelines on configuring MeshHook, including environment variables, database connections, and webhook setup.
4. **Security Setup:** Steps for setting up RLS, secrets management, and webhook signature verification.
5. **Monitoring and Logging:** Instructions on setting up monitoring and logging, integrating with Supabase Realtime for live logs.
6. **Scaling and Performance Tuning:** Guidelines for scaling MeshHook and tuning for performance.
7. **Troubleshooting:** Common pitfalls and troubleshooting tips.

### Data Model

No changes to the data model are required for this task. However, the deployment guide will reference the existing schema to ensure users correctly set up their databases.

### API Endpoints

Not applicable for this task.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Deployment guide covers all listed functional requirements.
- [ ] Guide validated for accuracy and ease of use in a testing environment.
- [ ] Instructions for environment setup, configuration, and security are clear and actionable.
- [ ] Documentation on scaling, performance tuning, and troubleshooting is comprehensive.
- [ ] All MeshHook components are covered, ensuring a complete deployment can be achieved following the guide.
- [ ] Feedback from a small group of external users confirms the guide's usability and clarity.

## Dependencies

### Technical Dependencies

- Access to various deployment environments for testing the guide (cloud services, Docker, Kubernetes).
- Current MeshHook codebase and infrastructure setup.

### Prerequisite Tasks

- Completion of all features and components that require deployment instructions.
- Availability of environment access and necessary permissions for documentation and testing purposes.

## Implementation Notes

### Development Guidelines

- Use clear, concise language and avoid jargon where possible.
- Include diagrams and code snippets where they add value.
- Validate all steps and commands in real deployment scenarios.

### Testing Strategy

- Test the deployment guide in multiple environments to ensure accuracy.
- Gather feedback from internal and external users to refine instructions.

### Security Considerations

- Emphasize the importance of secure configurations, including database connections, webhook verification, and secrets management.
- Include steps for regular security audits and updates.

### Monitoring & Observability

- Guide users on setting up monitoring and observability tools.
- Highlight the importance of live logs via Supabase Realtime for operational visibility.

## Related Documentation

- Existing MeshHook documentation (Architecture, Security Guidelines, Operations Guide).
- External documentation for tools and services recommended in the deployment guide (e.g., Supabase, Docker, Kubernetes documentation).
