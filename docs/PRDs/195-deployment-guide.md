# PRD: Deployment Guide

## Overview

The deployment guide is a critical component of the MeshHook project's Phase 8: Developer Documentation. This guide's primary objective is to provide clear, concise, and comprehensive instructions for deploying MeshHook instances. It aligns with MeshHook's overarching goals by facilitating the deployment process for webhook triggers, visual DAG builders, durable runs, live logs, and multi-tenant RLS security features.

The deployment guide aims to ensure that users — from indie builders to platform teams — can deploy MeshHook with confidence, understanding the necessary steps and considerations for a secure, efficient, and reliable setup.

## Technical Specifications

### Architecture Context

<<<<<<< HEAD
MeshHook leverages a combination of SvelteKit (for SSR/API), Supabase (for database and real-time operations), and distributed workers. The deployment architecture must consider these components, ensuring they are correctly configured and secured.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Gather Requirements:** Detail the technical and infrastructure requirements for running MeshHook.
2. **Environment Setup:** Instructions for setting up various environments, including cloud services (AWS, GCP, Azure), Docker, and Kubernetes.
3. **Configuration:** Guidelines on configuring MeshHook, including environment variables, database connections, and webhook setup.
4. **Security Setup:** Steps for setting up RLS, secrets management, and webhook signature verification.
5. **Monitoring and Logging:** Instructions on setting up monitoring and logging, integrating with Supabase Realtime for live logs.
6. **Scaling and Performance Tuning:** Guidelines for scaling MeshHook and tuning for performance.
7. **Troubleshooting:** Common pitfalls and troubleshooting tips.

### Data Model

No changes to the data model are required for this task. However, the deployment guide will reference the existing schema to ensure users correctly set up their databases.
=======
MeshHook utilizes a combination of SvelteKit for SSR/API handling, Supabase for backend services, and a worker-based architecture for orchestration and execution. The deployment guide must consider these components and their interdependencies.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Gather Information:** Review the current MeshHook architecture, focusing on deployment-related aspects.
2. **Environment Setup:** Document the setup instructions for each supported environment, including prerequisites.
3. **Configuration:** Detail the process for configuring MeshHook components post-deployment.
4. **Security:** Integrate security best practices throughout the deployment instructions.
5. **Validation:** Provide steps to validate a successful deployment.
6. **Maintenance:** Outline maintenance tasks, including updates and monitoring.

### Data Model
