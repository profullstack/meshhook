# PRD: Deployment Guide for MeshHook

## Overview

The Deployment Guide for MeshHook is a crucial piece of documentation aimed at streamlining the deployment process for developers and teams looking to leverage MeshHook for building webhook-first, deterministic, Postgres-native workflow engines. This guide is designed to align with the project's objectives by providing a step-by-step manual for deploying MeshHook instances efficiently, with a focus on security, scalability, and reliability.

### Purpose

The primary purpose of this guide is to ensure users, ranging from individual developers to large platform teams, can deploy MeshHook with confidence. By offering detailed deployment instructions, the guide supports MeshHook's commitment to offering a visual workflow engine that's easy to host, scale, and integrate with existing systems.

### Alignment with Project Goals

This Deployment Guide directly supports MeshHook's goals by facilitating the deployment of its key features:
- Webhook triggers with signature verification
- Visual DAG builder for workflow design
- Durable and replayable runs
- Real-time logging
- Multi-tenant security with Row-Level Security (RLS)

By doing so, it enables users to fully leverage MeshHook's capabilities in their projects or platforms.

## Functional Requirements

1. **Comprehensive Deployment Instructions**: The guide must provide detailed steps for the entire deployment lifecycle including initial setup, configuration, security best practices, scaling, and maintenance.
2. **Environment-Specific Guidance**: Tailor instructions for different deployment environments such as cloud services (AWS, GCP, Azure), Docker, and Kubernetes to ensure broad accessibility.
3. **Configuration Management**: Clearly outline how to manage MeshHook configurations for various scenarios, emphasizing security, performance, and reliability considerations.
4. **Update and Rollback Procedures**: Include clear procedures for updating MeshHook instances and rolling back changes in case of deployment failures or issues.
5. **Supporting Tools and Scripts**: Recommend and document the use of specific tools or scripts that facilitate the deployment process, ensuring users have access to resources that simplify complex steps.

## Non-Functional Requirements

- **Usability**: The guide should be accessible and understandable to users with varying levels of technical expertise, featuring a clear, logical structure.
- **Accuracy**: Ensure all instructions are thoroughly tested and validated for correctness, providing users with reliable information.
- **Maintainability**: The documentation must be easy to update in response to MeshHook updates or changes, supporting the project's evolution.

## Technical Specifications

### Architecture Context

MeshHook's architecture involves several key components:
- SvelteKit for server-side rendering (SSR) and APIs
- Supabase for database operations, real-time functionalities, and security
- Distributed workers for processing webhook triggers and other tasks

The deployment architecture must ensure these components are correctly configured, secured, and optimized for performance.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Requirements Gathering**: Define the technical and infrastructural prerequisites for deploying MeshHook.
2. **Environment Setup**: Offer detailed steps for preparing various environments, including cloud platforms and containerization tools.
3. **Configuration**: Provide comprehensive guidance on MeshHook's configuration, covering environment variables, database connections, and webhook configurations.
4. **Security Setup**: Document the setup process for key security features, including RLS, secrets management, and webhook signature verification.
5. **Monitoring and Logging**: Explain how to integrate monitoring tools and set up Supabase Realtime for live logging.
6. **Scaling and Performance**: Offer strategies for scaling MeshHook instances and tips for performance optimization.
7. **Troubleshooting**: Include common issues and their solutions to assist users in resolving deployment problems efficiently.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Comprehensive coverage of all functional requirements in the deployment guide.
- Successful validation of the guide in different environments, ensuring accuracy and usability.
- Clear, actionable instructions for setup, configuration, and security, enabling users to deploy MeshHook efficiently.
- Thorough documentation on scaling, performance optimization, and troubleshooting.
- Positive feedback from external users on the guide's clarity and usefulness.

## Dependencies

### Technical Dependencies

- Access to cloud services, Docker, and Kubernetes for guide validation.
- The current MeshHook codebase and infrastructure components.

### Prerequisite Tasks

- Completion of MeshHook's core features requiring deployment documentation.
- Setup of necessary access permissions for documentation and testing.

## Implementation Notes

### Development Guidelines

- Employ clear, jargon-free language to ensure accessibility for non-experts.
- Incorporate diagrams and code snippets to enhance understanding and engagement.
- Validate all deployment steps in real-world scenarios to guarantee reliability.

### Testing Strategy

- Test the deployment instructions across multiple environments to confirm their accuracy and comprehensiveness.
- Collect and incorporate feedback from both internal and external users to refine the guide.

### Security Considerations

- Highlight the configuration of secure connections, secret management, and RLS setup.
- Recommend regular security audits and updates to maintain the integrity of MeshHook deployments.

### Monitoring & Observability

- Guide users in setting up effective monitoring and observability practices.
- Emphasize the role of live logs via Supabase Realtime for operational transparency and troubleshooting.

## Related Documentation

- Link to existing MeshHook documentation on architecture, security guidelines, and operational procedures.
- Reference external documentation for recommended tools and services, ensuring users have access to additional resources for a successful deployment.
