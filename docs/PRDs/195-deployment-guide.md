# PRD: Deployment Guide for MeshHook

**Issue:** [#195](https://github.com/profullstack/meshhook/issues/195)  
**Milestone:** Phase 8: Documentation  
**Labels:** developer-documentation, hacktoberfest  
**Owner:** Anthony Ettinger (Profullstack)  
**License:** MIT  

## Overview

The deployment guide is a critical piece of the MeshHook project's Developer Documentation, designed to provide comprehensive instructions for deploying MeshHook in various environments. This guide aligns with MeshHook's goals of delivering a webhook-first, deterministic, Postgres-native workflow engine with an emphasis on simplicity, durability, and security.

**Objective:** Create a detailed, step-by-step deployment guide that enables developers and system administrators to successfully deploy MeshHook with confidence.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

1. **Comprehensive Instructions:** Cover deployment steps for key environments, including local development, cloud (AWS, GCP, Azure), and containerized (Docker, Kubernetes) setups.
2. **Configuration Guide:** Detail the configuration of MeshHook components, including webhook triggers, SvelteKit/Svelte 5 visual DAG builder, Supabase Realtime, and multi-tenant RLS security.
3. **Environment-Specific Considerations:** Address specific requirements and best practices for each deployment environment.
4. **Troubleshooting:** Provide a troubleshooting section for common deployment issues.
5. **Update and Rollback:** Instructions on updating MeshHook versions and rolling back if necessary.
6. **Security Best Practices:** Include a section on securing MeshHook deployments, referencing the project's security guidelines.

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **Usability:** Clear, concise, and easy-to-follow instructions.
- **Accuracy:** Ensure technical accuracy and alignment with the current MeshHook version.
- **Maintainability:** Structured in a way that is easy to update as MeshHook evolves.

## Technical Specifications

### Architecture Context

MeshHook utilizes a combination of SvelteKit for SSR/API handling, Supabase for backend services, and a worker-based architecture for orchestration and execution. The deployment guide must consider these components and their interdependencies.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Gather Information:** Review the current MeshHook architecture, focusing on deployment-related aspects.
2. **Environment Setup:** Document the setup instructions for each supported environment, including prerequisites.
3. **Configuration:** Detail the process for configuring MeshHook components post-deployment.
4. **Security:** Integrate security best practices throughout the deployment instructions.
5. **Validation:** Provide steps to validate a successful deployment.
6. **Maintenance:** Outline maintenance tasks, including updates and monitoring.
