# PRD: Secret Masking in UI

## Overview

**Task Objective:** Implement secret masking within the MeshHook UI to enhance security and privacy by preventing the exposure of sensitive information.

This task supports MeshHook's goal of providing a secure, multi-tenant webhook-first workflow engine by ensuring that secrets, such as API keys and tokens, are not visible in the UI. It aligns with our security principles, particularly around secret management and PII redaction, contributing to a trustworthy user experience.

## Functional Requirements

1. **Secret Masking:** Implement a UI mechanism to mask secrets (e.g., API keys, tokens) in the MeshHook dashboard, making them visible only when explicitly requested by the user.
2. **Toggle Visibility:** Users should be able to toggle the visibility of secrets, with secrets masked by default.
3. **Clipboard Copy:** Provide an option to copy the secret to the clipboard without making it visible, to facilitate usability without compromising security.
4. **Integration with Existing Secret Management:** The secret masking feature must integrate seamlessly with MeshHook's existing secret management workflows, including creation, editing, and deletion of secrets.
5. **User Permission Checks:** Ensure that only users with appropriate permissions can toggle the visibility of secrets or copy them to the clipboard.
6. **Logging and Auditing:** Any action taken on secrets (e.g., visibility toggle, copying to clipboard) should be logged for auditing purposes.

## Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** Secret masking and unmasking actions must not introduce significant latency in the UI response times.
- **Security:** The implementation must adhere to the project's security guidelines, ensuring that secrets are handled securely throughout their lifecycle.
- **Usability:** The UI components for secret masking should be intuitive and consistent with the overall design language of MeshHook.
- **Accessibility:** Implement accessibility best practices to ensure that the secret masking feature is usable by all users, including those using assistive technologies.

## Technical Specifications

### Architecture Context

MeshHook leverages a SvelteKit-based frontend, with Supabase for backend services including database, realtime updates, and storage. This task requires close integration with the frontend components handling secrets within the dashboard.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Design UI Components:** Develop Svelte components for displaying secrets with masking functionality. Include a toggle button for visibility and an icon for clipboard copying.
2. **Integrate with Supabase:** Utilize Supabase client libraries to fetch and update secrets, ensuring that all operations are performed securely and in accordance with our RLS policies.
3. **Clipboard API:** Implement secure usage of the Clipboard API for the copy-to-clipboard feature, ensuring that it works across all supported browsers.
4. **Logging**: Integrate with the existing logging infrastructure to capture actions performed on secrets for auditing purposes.
5. **Testing:** Write comprehensive unit and integration tests covering all new functionality and potential edge cases related to secret management.
6. **Documentation:** Update the project documentation, including the user guide and API documentation as necessary, to cover the new secret masking features.

### Data Model

No changes to the existing data model are required for this task. However, the implementation may necessitate additional logging tables or fields to capture audit logs related to secret access and visibility toggling.

### API Endpoints

No new API endpoints are required. Existing endpoints for secret management will be utilized, but may require updates to support logging of visibility and copy actions.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Secret masking UI component implemented and integrated with the dashboard.
- [ ] Users can toggle the visibility of secrets and copy secrets to the clipboard without exposing them.
- [ ] Actions on secrets are logged for auditing purposes.
- [ ] All unit and integration tests pass.
- [ ] The feature adheres to MeshHook's performance, security, and usability standards.
- [ ] Documentation is updated to reflect the new feature.

## Dependencies

- Access to the MeshHook codebase and development environment.
- Supabase client libraries for SvelteKit.

## Implementation Notes

### Development Guidelines

- Follow the SvelteKit and JavaScript best practices as documented in the project's contribution guidelines.
- Ensure that all new code is fully tested and documented.
- Adhere to accessibility guidelines to ensure the feature is accessible to all users.

### Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests:** Focus on individual components and utility functions.
- **Integration Tests:** Test the interaction between the UI components and the Supabase backend, including permission checks and logging.
- **Manual Testing:** Perform manual testing in various browsers and devices to ensure compatibility and usability.

### Security Considerations

- Ensure that secrets are never exposed in the UI unless explicitly requested by the user.
- Utilize Supabase's RLS policies to enforce permission checks on secret operations.
- Securely implement the Clipboard API to prevent clipboard poisoning and other clipboard-related attacks.

### Monitoring & Observability

- Extend the existing monitoring setup to include metrics and logs related to secret masking and access, enabling quick identification and resolution of any issues.
