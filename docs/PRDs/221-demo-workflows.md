## Overview

The objective of this task is to create demo workflows to showcase MeshHook's capabilities, aligning with the project's vision of providing a visually simple, durable, webhook-first workflow engine. These demo workflows will serve as practical examples for potential users, demonstrating the ease of building, deploying, and monitoring workflows within MeshHook. By providing these demos, we aim to lower the entry barrier for new users, highlight key features, and encourage adoption.

### Goals
- Showcase MeshHook's core features through practical examples.
- Highlight the simplicity of building workflows with the visual DAG builder.
- Demonstrate the durability and reliability of workflow runs.
- Provide a starting point for new users to build their own workflows.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
1. **Demo Workflow Creation:** Design and implement a set of demo workflows that cover MeshHook's capabilities, including webhook triggers, visual DAG building, durable runs, and multi-tenant security.
2. **Documentation and Guides:** Provide detailed documentation and user guides for each demo workflow, explaining the purpose, setup, and key concepts demonstrated.
3. **Ease of Deployment:** Ensure demo workflows can be easily deployed by new users, with minimal setup required.

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance:** Demo workflows should perform efficiently, with response times showcasing the system's capability to handle workflows smoothly.
- **Reliability:** Workflows should demonstrate MeshHook's error handling, retry mechanisms, and overall durability.
- **Security:** Implement and highlight security best practices within the demo workflows, including webhook signature verification and secure handling of secrets.

## Technical Specifications

### Architecture Context
The demo workflows will be built using the existing MeshHook architecture, employing:
- **SvelteKit/Svelte 5** for the visual DAG builder.
- **Supabase** for real-time database interactions, logging, and multi-tenant security.
- **Event Sourcing** for durable, replayable runs.

### Implementation Approach
1. **Identify Key Use Cases:** Select a set of use cases that best demonstrate MeshHook's features.
2. **Design Workflows:** For each use case, design a workflow that highlights MeshHook's capabilities.
3. **Develop and Test:** Implement the workflows, ensuring they meet functional and non-functional requirements.
4. **Documentation:** Write comprehensive guides and documentation for each workflow.
5. **User Feedback Loop:** Gather initial feedback from a small group of users and refine the demos based on their input.

### Data Model
No new data model changes are required specifically for this task. Utilization of existing schemas will suffice for demo creation.

### API Endpoints
No new API endpoints will be introduced. The demos will use existing endpoints for workflow creation, execution, and monitoring.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] A set of demo workflows is created, covering key MeshHook features.
- [ ] Documentation and guides for each demo workflow are completed and easy to follow.
- [ ] Demos can be easily deployed by new users, with clear instructions provided.
- [ ] Performance benchmarks meet the project's standards.
- [ ] Security best practices are implemented and highlighted in the demos.
- [ ] Feedback from initial user tests is positive, indicating the demos are helpful.

## Dependencies

### Technical Dependencies
- Access to a fully set up MeshHook environment.
- Existing documentation and codebase for reference.

### Prerequisite Tasks
- Ensure the visual DAG builder and webhook features are fully operational.
- Confirm that the documentation framework allows for easy addition of new guides.

## Implementation Notes

### Development Guidelines
- Follow MeshHook's coding and documentation standards.
- Use clear, descriptive naming for workflows and steps to enhance understanding.

### Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests:** Cover logic and utility functions used within the workflows.
- **Integration Tests:** Ensure workflows integrate correctly with MeshHook's components.
- **User Acceptance Testing:** Conduct tests with potential users to gather feedback on the usefulness and clarity of the demos.

### Security Considerations
- Adhere to MeshHook's security guidelines, especially for handling webhooks and managing secrets.
- Ensure all demo workflows are designed with security best practices in mind.

### Monitoring & Observability
- Incorporate logging and monitoring within the demo workflows to showcase real-time insights available through MeshHook.
