# PRD: Implementation of Demo Workflows for MeshHook

## 1. Overview

The purpose of this PRD is to outline the development and deployment of a series of demo workflows for MeshHook. These demos aim to showcase MeshHook's capabilities, including webhook triggers with signature verification, visual DAG building, durable runs, live logs, and multi-tenant security. The goal is to lower the barrier to entry for new users, provide educational content, and demonstrate the flexibility and robustness of MeshHook through real-world examples.

### Objectives
- Showcase MeshHook's core features through diverse, real-world demo workflows.
- Provide a hands-on learning experience for new users.
- Illustrate best practices in workflow design and implementation within MeshHook's ecosystem.

## 2. Functional Requirements

1. **Demo Workflow Creation:** Develop a minimum of three demo workflows highlighting different MeshHook features and use cases (e.g., data processing, event-driven automation, orchestration with conditional logic).
   
2. **Documentation and Guides:** Produce comprehensive documentation for each demo, including setup instructions, workflow description, and a detailed explanation of MeshHook features utilized.
   
3. **Import and Deployment Simplicity:** Ensure that demos are easily importable and deployable by users, with explicit instructions and minimal setup required.
   
4. **Feature Demonstration:** Each demo should utilize and explain MeshHook's core features, such as webhook triggers, visual DAG building, live logs, and Supabase Realtime integration for monitoring.

## 3. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** Demos must perform efficiently, highlighting MeshHook's capacity for rapid processing and execution.
- **Reliability:** Illustrate MeshHook's fault tolerance and durability through built-in error handling and retry mechanisms in the workflows.
- **Security:** Emphasize secure practices, particularly in webhook signature verification and sensitive data handling.
- **Maintainability:** Ensure that the demo code is readable, well-commented, and adheres to MeshHook's coding standards for easy future modifications.

## 4. Technical Specifications

### Architecture Integration
- Utilize MeshHook's existing infrastructure, including its SvelteKit frontend for DAG visualization and Supabase for real-time data updates and security.
- Implement the demos as modular, standalone examples that can be integrated into MeshHook without requiring modifications to the core architecture.

### Implementation Approach
1. **Identify Use Cases:** Select varied scenarios that effectively demonstrate MeshHook's capabilities.
2. **Design Workflows:** Design each workflow to address its intended use case while showcasing MeshHook's features.
3. **Implement and Document:** Develop the workflows, accompanied by thorough documentation for each step, from setup to execution.
4. **User Testing:** Conduct testing with a group of early adopters for feedback and refinement.

### Data Model and API Endpoints
- **No Data Model Changes Required:** Implementing demo workflows will not necessitate changes to the existing data models.
- **API Endpoints:** Utilize existing endpoints for workflow operations, ensuring that demos are fully compatible with MeshHook's current API.

## 5. Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Three demo workflows developed, covering distinct use cases and functionalities.
- [ ] Comprehensive documentation provided for each demo, adhering to MeshHook's standards.
- [ ] Demos can be easily imported and deployed by users, as evidenced by user feedback.
- [ ] Key features of MeshHook are effectively demonstrated and documented in the context of the demos.
- [ ] Feedback from user testing confirms the educational value and usability of the demos.

## 6. Dependencies

- Complete functionality and documentation of all MeshHook features used in the demos.
- Access to MeshHook's development environment, including SvelteKit and Supabase.

## 7. Implementation Notes

### Development Guidelines
- Follow MeshHook's coding and documentation standards.
- Ensure code is modular, well-commented, and includes robust error handling.

### Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests:** Cover individual components and logic within the demos.
- **Integration Tests:** Confirm integration with existing MeshHook features.
- **User Acceptance Testing:** Validate the demos with real users for clarity and effectiveness.

### Security Considerations
- Adhere to MeshHook's security practices, especially for webhook processing and secret management.
- Ensure the demos do not inadvertently expose sensitive information or introduce vulnerabilities.

### Monitoring and Observability
- Incorporate Supabase Realtime for monitoring demo workflows, showcasing MeshHook's real-time logging and observability features.

By fulfilling the requirements and considerations outlined in this PRD, the MeshHook project will enrich its offering with valuable, practical examples that demonstrate its capabilities and encourage user engagement and adoption.
