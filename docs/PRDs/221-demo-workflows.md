# PRD: Demo Workflows for MeshHook

## Overview

<<<<<<< HEAD
The objective of this Product Requirements Document (PRD) is to detail the creation and implementation of demo workflows for MeshHook, a webhook-first, deterministic, Postgres-native workflow engine. This task aligns with MeshHook's core goal of showcasing its capabilities, such as webhook triggers with signature verification, visual DAG building, durable runs, live logs, and multi-tenant security, through practical and relatable examples. By providing these demo workflows, we aim to demonstrate MeshHook's ease of use, flexibility, and robustness, encouraging adoption and providing a solid starting point for users to build their own workflows.

### Purpose
- To illustrate MeshHook's core features and capabilities through practical, real-world examples.
- To lower the barrier to entry for new users by providing easy-to-understand and deploy demo workflows.
- To serve as documentation and educational material, showcasing best practices and potential use cases.

## Functional Requirements

1. **Demo Workflow Design and Implementation:** Create a set of at least three demo workflows that exemplify MeshHook's key features, focusing on diverse use cases such as data processing, event-driven automation, and multi-step orchestration with conditional logic.
2. **Comprehensive Documentation:** For each demo workflow, provide detailed documentation that includes an overview of the workflow, a step-by-step guide on setting it up, and an explanation of how it leverages MeshHook's features.
3. **Ease of Use:** Ensure each demo workflow can be easily imported and deployed by users, with clear instructions and minimal prerequisites.
4. **Visibility and Debugging:** Demonstrate the use of live logs and the Supabase Realtime feature for monitoring workflow execution and debugging.
=======
The objective of this task is to create demo workflows to showcase MeshHook's capabilities, aligning with the project's vision of providing a visually simple, durable, webhook-first workflow engine. These demo workflows will serve as practical examples for potential users, demonstrating the ease of building, deploying, and monitoring workflows within MeshHook. By providing these demos, we aim to lower the entry barrier for new users, highlight key features, and encourage adoption.

### Goals
- Showcase MeshHook's core features through practical examples.
- Highlight the simplicity of building workflows with the visual DAG builder.
- Demonstrate the durability and reliability of workflow runs.
- Provide a starting point for new users to build their own workflows.

## Technical Specifications

### Architecture Context
<<<<<<< HEAD
The demo workflows will leverage MeshHook's existing architecture, utilizing SvelteKit for the visual DAG builder, Supabase for real-time interactions and security, and event sourcing patterns for durability. These workflows are to be designed as standalone examples that can be easily integrated into any MeshHook setup.

### Implementation Approach
1. **Use Case Identification:** Identify a diverse set of use cases that can be addressed by MeshHook's features.
2. **Workflow Design:** Design workflows that are not only demonstrative of MeshHook's capabilities but also practical and relatable to potential users.
3. **Development:** Implement the workflows, ensuring adherence to both functional and non-functional requirements.
4. **Documentation:** Create detailed guides for each demo workflow, including their purpose, setup instructions, and a deep dive into their design and functionality.
5. **User Testing:** Conduct user testing with a small group of early adopters to gather feedback and make necessary adjustments.

### Data Model and API Endpoints
- **Data Model Changes:** No changes to the existing data model are required for the implementation of demo workflows.
- **API Endpoints:** Utilize existing MeshHook API endpoints for workflow creation, execution, and monitoring.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] At least three diverse demo workflows have been created and documented.
- [ ] Each demo includes detailed setup and usage documentation that aligns with MeshHook's documentation standards.
- [ ] Demo workflows can be easily imported and deployed by new users, with minimal external dependencies.
- [ ] Demonstrated use of key MeshHook features, such as webhook triggers, visual DAG building, and live logs.
- [ ] Positive feedback from user testing, indicating that the demos are helpful and informative.

## Dependencies

- **Technical Dependencies:** Access to MeshHook's full development environment, including SvelteKit and Supabase.
- **Prerequisite Tasks:** Ensure that all components and features of MeshHook used in the demos are fully operational and documented.
