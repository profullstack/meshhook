# PRD: Implementation of Demo Workflows for MeshHook

## 1. Overview

With MeshHook approaching its launch phase, the introduction of demo workflows serves a strategic role in highlighting the platform's capabilities and easing the onboarding process for new users. This PRD outlines the implementation of a set of demo workflows designed to showcase MeshHook's core features, including webhook triggers with signature verification, visual DAG building, durable runs, live logs, and multi-tenant RLS security. By providing practical, real-world examples of how MeshHook can be utilized, we aim to accelerate user adoption and demonstrate the platform's versatility and strength in automating complex workflows.

### Objectives

- **Demonstrate Core Features**: Clearly showcase MeshHook's unique capabilities through practical examples.
- **Ease Onboarding**: Help new users quickly understand and utilize MeshHook's features.
- **Support Documentation**: Offer detailed examples that can be referenced in documentation and tutorials.

## 2. Functional Requirements

1. **Diverse Demo Workflows**: Develop a minimum of three demo workflows that illustrate MeshHook's application across different use cases, such as data processing, automated alerts, and integration workflows.
   
2. **Documentation and Tutorials**: Create comprehensive guides for each demo workflow, detailing the setup process, execution flow, and a walkthrough of how each MeshHook feature is used.
   
3. **Simplicity in Deployment**: Ensure the demo workflows are packaged for easy import and deployment, with minimal external dependencies and straightforward configuration steps.

4. **Feature Highlight**: Each demo should highlight specific features of MeshHook, such as signature verification for webhook triggers, the visual DAG builder's capabilities, and the use of Supabase Realtime for live logs.

## 3. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance**: The demo workflows should be optimized to run efficiently, showcasing MeshHook's high performance.
  
- **Reliability**: Include robust error handling and demonstrate MeshHook's reliability through retry mechanisms and fault tolerance.
  
- **Security**: Highlight MeshHook's security features, such as signature verification and RLS, ensuring that demos follow best security practices.
  
- **Maintainability**: Code the demos with clarity and adhere to MeshHook's coding standards, ensuring they are easy to update and extend.

## 4. Technical Specifications

### Architecture Integration

The demo workflows will be built within MeshHook's existing infrastructure, utilizing the SvelteKit/Svelte 5 for DAG visualization and Supabase for real-time updates and security enforcement. This ensures that the demos can be directly applied and executed in any standard MeshHook environment without requiring substantial modifications.

### Implementation Steps

1. **Scenario Selection**: Identify common automation scenarios that are representative of MeshHook's target use cases.
   
2. **Demo Development**: Construct demo workflows using MeshHook's visual builder, focusing on clarity, efficiency, and the utilization of MeshHook's features.
   
3. **Documentation**: Draft detailed guides and tutorials for each demo, explaining the setup, execution, and feature utilization.
   
4. **User Feedback**: Implement a feedback loop with beta testers to refine and adjust the demos based on real user experiences.

### Data Model and API Usage

- **Data Model**: No changes to the existing data model are necessary for the implementation of demo workflows.
  
- **API Endpoints**: Leverage MeshHook's current API endpoints for creating, managing, and executing workflows. Document the use of these endpoints within the demo guides.

## 5. Acceptance Criteria

- **Demo Completion**: At least three demo workflows are fully developed, documented, and ready for user deployment.
  
- **Documentation Quality**: Guides and tutorials are complete, easy to understand, and follow MeshHook's documentation standards.
  
- **User Feedback**: Early user testing indicates that the demos effectively demonstrate MeshHook's capabilities and facilitate easy adoption.
  
- **Feature Showcase**: Each demo workflow effectively highlights key features of MeshHook as intended.

## 6. Dependencies

- Access to the latest version of MeshHook's development environment.
- Availability of all MeshHook features intended for demonstration.
  
## 7. Implementation Notes

### Development Practices

- Follow MeshHook's coding and documentation standards strictly.
- Ensure code is modular, well-commented, and adheres to best practices for maintainability and extensibility.
- Incorporate comprehensive error handling and validations as part of the workflow design to emphasize reliability and security.

### Testing and Validation

- **Unit Testing**: Ensure each component of the demo workflows is thoroughly unit tested.
  
- **Integration Testing**: Validate the integration of the demo workflows with MeshHook's broader platform to ensure seamless operation.
  
- **User Acceptance Testing (UAT)**: Engage a group of beta testers to use the demos and provide feedback on their effectiveness and clarity.

### Security Measures

- Adhere to MeshHook's established security protocols, especially concerning data handling and webhook processing.
- Ensure that demo workflows do not expose sensitive information or introduce vulnerabilities.

### Monitoring and Observability

- Utilize Supabase Realtime to demonstrate real-time monitoring and log streaming capabilities within the demo workflows, ensuring users can observe the live status and outputs of their workflows.

By fulfilling these requirements and considerations, the demo workflows will not only serve as powerful tools for onboarding and educating users but also as robust demonstrations of MeshHook's capabilities and advantages in workflow automation.
