# PRD: Demo Workflows for MeshHook

## Overview

The objective of this Product Requirements Document (PRD) is to detail the creation and implementation of demo workflows for MeshHook, a webhook-first, deterministic, Postgres-native workflow engine. This task aligns with MeshHook's core goal of showcasing its capabilities, such as webhook triggers with signature verification, visual DAG building, durable runs, live logs, and multi-tenant security, through practical and relatable examples. By providing these demo workflows, we aim to demonstrate MeshHook's ease of use, flexibility, and robustness, encouraging adoption and providing a solid starting point for users to build their own workflows.

### Purpose
- To illustrate MeshHook's core features and capabilities through practical, real-world examples.
- To lower the barrier to entry for new users by providing easy-to-understand and deploy demo workflows.
- To serve as documentation and educational material, showcasing best practices and potential use cases.

## Functional Requirements

1. **Demo Workflow Design and Implementation:** Create a set of at least three demo workflows that exemplify MeshHook's key features, focusing on diverse use cases such as data processing, event-driven automation, and multi-step orchestration with conditional logic.
2. **Comprehensive Documentation:** For each demo workflow, provide detailed documentation that includes an overview of the workflow, a step-by-step guide on setting it up, and an explanation of how it leverages MeshHook's features.
3. **Ease of Use:** Ensure each demo workflow can be easily imported and deployed by users, with clear instructions and minimal prerequisites.
4. **Visibility and Debugging:** Demonstrate the use of live logs and the Supabase Realtime feature for monitoring workflow execution and debugging.

## Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** Each demo workflow should execute efficiently, exemplifying MeshHook's ability to handle processes swiftly.
- **Reliability:** Highlight MeshHook's durability and reliability through error handling, retries, and other fault-tolerance features within the demo workflows.
- **Security:** Showcase security practices, including the use of webhook signature verification and secure handling of secrets within workflows.
- **Maintainability:** Code for the demo workflows should follow MeshHook's coding standards, be well-documented, and structured for easy understanding and modification.

## Technical Specifications

### Architecture Context
The demo workflows will leverage MeshHook's existing architecture, utilizing SvelteKit for the visual DAG builder, Supabase for real-time interactions and security, and event sourcing patterns for durability. These workflows are to be designed as standalone examples that can be easily integrated into any MeshHook setup.

### Implementation Approach
1. **Use Case Identification:** Identify a diverse set of use cases that can be addressed by MeshHook's features.
2. **Workflow Design:** Design workflows that are not only demonstrative of MeshHook's capabilities but also practical and relatable to potential users.
3. **Development:** Implement the workflows, ensuring adherence to both functional and non-functional requirements.
4. **Documentation:** Create detailed guides for each demo workflow, including their purpose, setup instructions, and a deep dive into their design and functionality.
5. **User Testing:** Conduct user testing with a small group of early adopters to gather feedback and make necessary adjustments.

### Data Model and API Endpoints
- **Data Model Changes:** No changes to the existing data model are required for the implementation of demo workflows.
- **API Endpoints:** Utilize existing MeshHook API endpoints for workflow creation, execution, and monitoring.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] At least three diverse demo workflows have been created and documented.
- [ ] Each demo includes detailed setup and usage documentation that aligns with MeshHook's documentation standards.
- [ ] Demo workflows can be easily imported and deployed by new users, with minimal external dependencies.
- [ ] Demonstrated use of key MeshHook features, such as webhook triggers, visual DAG building, and live logs.
- [ ] Positive feedback from user testing, indicating that the demos are helpful and informative.

## Dependencies

- **Technical Dependencies:** Access to MeshHook's full development environment, including SvelteKit and Supabase.
- **Prerequisite Tasks:** Ensure that all components and features of MeshHook used in the demos are fully operational and documented.

## Implementation Notes

### Development Guidelines
- Adhere to MeshHook's coding standards and best practices.
- Ensure code is modular, well-commented, and easy to follow.
- Incorporate error handling and validation to promote robust and secure workflows.

### Testing Strategy
- **Unit Testing:** Validate individual components and logic within the demo workflows.
- **Integration Testing:** Ensure seamless integration with MeshHook's existing features and infrastructure.
- **User Acceptance Testing (UAT):** Validate the demos with real users to ensure clarity, usefulness, and operational efficiency.

### Security Considerations
- Follow MeshHook's security guidelines, particularly in areas of webhook handling and secret management.
- Ensure demos do not expose sensitive information or introduce security vulnerabilities.

### Monitoring & Observability
- Utilize Supabase Realtime for live monitoring of demo workflows, demonstrating MeshHook's observability capabilities.

## Related Documentation
- MeshHook's main PRD, Architecture overview, and Security guidelines should be referenced for alignment and consistency.

**Completion of this task will enrich MeshHook's offering by providing tangible, relatable examples of its capabilities, thereby facilitating user adoption and understanding.**
