# PRD: Implementation of Demo Workflows for MeshHook

## 1. Overview

The task involves creating and implementing a set of demo workflows for MeshHook, aimed at showcasing its core features and capabilities. These demo workflows are intended to serve as practical, real-world examples that highlight MeshHook's functionalities, including webhook triggers with signature verification, visual DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) building, durable runs, live logs, and multi-tenant security. The ultimate goal is to simplify the onboarding process for new users, demonstrate MeshHook's utility in various scenarios, and emphasize its ease of use and flexibility.

### Purpose

- To illustrate the practical application of MeshHook's features through real-world examples.
- To aid in the rapid adoption and effective use of MeshHook by new users.
- To provide a foundation for comprehensive documentation and educational materials related to MeshHook.

## 2. Functional Requirements

1. **Design and Development of Demo Workflows**: Create at least three diverse demo workflows that exemplify the use of MeshHook in various scenarios, such as API data aggregation, automated notification systems, and complex multi-step processes.
   
2. **Comprehensive Documentation**: Develop detailed documentation for each demo workflow, covering its purpose, setup and deployment instructions, and a description of how it leverages MeshHook's features.
   
3. **Ease of Import and Deployment**: Package the demo workflows to ensure they can be easily imported and deployed by users, focusing on reducing setup complexity and dependencies.
   
4. **Feature Demonstration**: Utilize the demos to showcase MeshHook's distinctive features, including but not limited to real-time live logs, secure webhook triggers, and the capabilities of the visual DAG builder.

## 3. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance**: Demo workflows should be optimized for performance, demonstrating MeshHook's capability to handle workflows efficiently.
  
- **Reliability**: Incorporate error handling and retry mechanisms within the demos to showcase MeshHook's fault tolerance and reliability.
  
- **Security**: Implement and highlight security best practices in the demo workflows, showcasing MeshHook's security features, including signature verification for webhook triggers.
  
- **Maintainability**: Design the demo workflows to be easily modifiable and extensible, adhering to MeshHook's coding standards and best practices.

## 4. Technical Specifications

### Architecture Context

The demo workflows will be seamlessly integrated with MeshHook's existing architecture, leveraging the SvelteKit-based visual DAG builder for workflow creation and Supabase for real-time functionality and security. These independent examples should be easily incorporable into any MeshHook installation, demonstrating versatility and ease of use.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Use Case Identification**: Select use cases that are common yet diverse enough to showcase the breadth of MeshHook's capabilities.
   
2. **Workflow Development**: Focus on creating clear, simple, and effective demo workflows that highlight MeshHook's features.
   
3. **Documentation Creation**: Write user-friendly documentation for each demo, ensuring clarity and comprehensiveness.
   
4. **Iterative Feedback**: Collect feedback on the demos and refine them as necessary to enhance their utility and clarity.

### Data Model and API Endpoints

- **Data Model Adjustments**: No adjustments to MeshHook's existing data models are required for the demo workflows.
  
- **API Endpoints**: The demos will utilize existing MeshHook API endpoints for workflow creation, execution, and monitoring.

## 5. Acceptance Criteria

- A minimum of three demo workflows are fully implemented and documented.
- The documentation is clear, comprehensive, and adheres to MeshHook's standards.
- Users can easily import and deploy the demos with minimal setup and external dependencies.
- MeshHook's key features are effectively demonstrated, with positive feedback from user testing.

## 6. Dependencies

- Access to MeshHook's development environment.
- Fully functional MeshHook components and features that the demos rely on.

## 7. Implementation Notes

### Development Guidelines

- Adhere to MeshHook's coding standards and best practices.
- Write modular, well-documented, and clean code to ensure ease of understanding and future modifications.
- Implement robust error handling and validation within the demo workflows to uphold MeshHook's commitment to security and reliability.

### Testing Strategy

- Conduct unit testing on individual components of the demo workflows.
- Perform integration testing to confirm seamless integration with MeshHook's existing features.
- Execute User Acceptance Testing (UAT) with a group of early adopters to gather feedback on the demos' usability and effectiveness.

### Security Considerations

- Follow MeshHook's established security best practices, particularly in relation to webhook processing and secret management.
- Ensure that the demo workflows do not introduce security vulnerabilities or expose sensitive information.

### Monitoring and Observability

- Integrate Supabase Realtime into the demo workflows to highlight MeshHook's capabilities in real-time monitoring and observability.

By fulfilling the requirements outlined in this PRD, we aim to create demo workflows that not only serve as effective educational tools for new MeshHook users but also as showcases of MeshHook's powerful and flexible workflow engine capabilities.
