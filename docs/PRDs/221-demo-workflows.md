# PRD: Demo Workflows for MeshHook

## Overview

This PRD outlines the task of creating and implementing demo workflows for MeshHook, a webhook-first, deterministic, Postgres-native workflow engine. The aim is to showcase MeshHook's core functionalities—such as webhook triggers with signature verification, visual DAG building, durable runs, live logs, and multi-tenant security—through easily understandable and deployable demo workflows. These demos are designed to lower the learning curve for new users, demonstrate best practices, and highlight MeshHook's capabilities in real-world scenarios, thereby encouraging adoption and user engagement.

### Purpose
- To demonstrate MeshHook's functionalities through practical examples.
- To facilitate ease of adoption for new users by providing clear, deployable demo workflows.
- To serve as a cornerstone for documentation and education on using MeshHook effectively.

## Functional Requirements

1. **Design and Implementation of Demo Workflows:** Develop a minimum of three demo workflows that cover a broad range of use cases, such as API data aggregation, automated notification systems, and conditional multi-step processes. These workflows should be designed to showcase MeshHook's key features effectively.
2. **Documentation:** Create detailed documentation for each demo, including an overview, setup and deployment instructions, and an explanation of how the workflow utilizes MeshHook's features. Documentation should be accessible and informative for users of all levels.
3. **Import and Deployment Simplicity:** Ensure that the demo workflows are packaged in a way that allows for easy import and deployment by users, with a focus on minimizing setup requirements and external dependencies.
4. **Feature Showcasing:** Utilize the demo workflows to demonstrate MeshHook's unique features, such as real-time live logs with Supabase Realtime, secure webhook triggers, and the visual DAG builder's capabilities.

## Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** Demo workflows should execute with optimal efficiency, showcasing MeshHook's performance capabilities.
- **Reliability:** The demos should include examples of error handling and retry mechanisms, highlighting MeshHook's reliability and fault tolerance.
- **Security:** Implement security best practices in the demos, including signature verification for webhook triggers and secure secret management, to exemplify MeshHook's security features.
- **Maintainability:** Ensure that the demo workflows are easy to understand, modify, and extend, adhering to MeshHook's coding standards and best practices.

## Technical Specifications

### Architecture Context
The demo workflows will integrate seamlessly with MeshHook's existing architecture, utilizing the SvelteKit-based visual DAG builder for workflow creation and Supabase for real-time functionality and security. These workflows will be independent examples that can be easily added to any MeshHook installation.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Use Case Selection:** Carefully select diverse use cases that are not only common but also showcase MeshHook's wide range of capabilities.
2. **Workflow Development:** Implement the demo workflows, focusing on clarity, simplicity, and the effective demonstration of MeshHook's features.
3. **Documentation Creation:** Write comprehensive, user-friendly documentation for each demo workflow.
4. **Feedback and Iteration:** Gather user feedback on the demo workflows and iterate on the design and documentation as necessary to ensure clarity and usefulness.

### Data Model and API Endpoints

- **Data Model Adjustments:** No adjustments to the existing data models are required for the addition of demo workflows.
- **API Endpoints:** The demo workflows will utilize existing MeshHook API endpoints for creating, executing, and monitoring workflows.

## Acceptance Criteria

- At least three diverse demo workflows are fully implemented and documented.
- Documentation for each demo is clear, comprehensive, and matches MeshHook's documentation standards.
- Demos can be easily imported and deployed by users, with minimal setup steps and dependencies.
- Key features of MeshHook are effectively demonstrated through the demos, with positive feedback from user testing.

## Dependencies

- Full access to MeshHook's development environment.
- All MeshHook components and features utilized in the demos must be fully functional.

## Implementation Notes

### Development Guidelines
- Follow MeshHook's established coding standards and best practices.
- Write modular, well-commented, and clean code to facilitate ease of understanding and future modifications.
- Include robust error handling and validation in the demo workflows to promote security and reliability.

### Testing Strategy
- Perform unit testing on individual components of the demo workflows.
- Conduct integration testing to ensure the demos integrate seamlessly with existing MeshHook features.
- Carry out User Acceptance Testing (UAT) with a group of early adopters to gather feedback on usability and effectiveness.

### Security Considerations
- Adhere to MeshHook's security best practices, especially regarding webhook handling and secret management.
- Ensure the demo workflows do not introduce any security vulnerabilities or expose sensitive information.

### Monitoring and Observability
- Incorporate the use of Supabase Realtime in the demo workflows to showcase MeshHook's real-time monitoring capabilities.

This PRD lays the foundation for creating demo workflows that not only serve as practical examples of MeshHook's capabilities but also as educational tools for new users. The successful completion of these demos will enhance MeshHook's value proposition and facilitate user onboarding and adoption.
