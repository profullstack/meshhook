# PRD: Demo Workflows for MeshHook

**Issue:** [#221](https://github.com/profullstack/meshhook/issues/221)  
**Milestone:** Phase 10: Polish & Launch  
**Labels:** launch-prep, hacktoberfest  
**Project Documentation:** [MeshHook Documentation](https://github.com/profullstack/meshhook)

## Overview

As MeshHook approaches its launch phase, it's imperative to showcase its capabilities and ease of use to potential users and stakeholders. The objective of creating demo workflows is to provide tangible, interactive examples that highlight MeshHook's core features, including its intuitive visual DAG builder, webhook triggers with signature verification, and durable, replayable runs. These demos will serve as both educational tools and marketing assets to demonstrate the power and flexibility of MeshHook.

### Objectives

- Create interactive demo workflows to showcase MeshHook's features.
- Highlight the simplicity of the visual DAG builder and the robustness of the execution engine.
- Provide clear, real-world use cases that potential users can relate to and explore.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

1. Create at least three distinct demo workflows, each highlighting different aspects of MeshHook:
   - **Data Transformation and Routing:** Utilize webhook triggers, `transform` nodes, and `http_call` nodes.
   - **Error Handling and Retries:** Demonstrate the use of retries, backoff strategies, and dead-letter queues.
   - **Multi-Tenant Security:** Showcase the multi-tenant RLS security model with an example of project-scoped secrets management.
2. Implement a guided tour within the MeshHook UI to walk users through each demo workflow, explaining key features and steps.
3. Ensure each demo workflow includes a predefined set of sample data that users can execute to see real-time results.

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **Usability:** Demos must be easily accessible and executable from the MeshHook UI with minimal setup required from the user.
- **Performance:** Demo workflows should execute within the expected sub-second response times for user-facing operations.
- **Reliability:** Ensure demo workflows are robust and error-free to prevent any negative impact on user perception.
- **Maintainability:** Code and configurations for demo workflows should be well-documented and structured for easy updates.

## Technical Specifications

### Architecture Context

- Utilize existing components as defined in the MeshHook architecture, including SvelteKit for the frontend, Supabase for backend services, and workers for orchestration and execution.
- Demo workflows should be predefined in the system but allow users to clone and modify them for experimentation.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Design Demo Workflows:** Collaborate with the product and engineering teams to select and design demo workflows that best showcase MeshHook's capabilities.
2. **Implement Workflows:** Using the visual DAG builder, create each demo workflow, ensuring to highlight different features in each scenario.
3. **Develop Guided Tours:** Implement guided tours within the UI using a JavaScript library like Shepherd.js or intro.js, providing step-by-step walkthroughs of each demo.
4. **Testing and Validation:** Thoroughly test each demo workflow and guided tour to ensure accuracy, performance, and reliability.
5. **Documentation:** Update the project documentation to include information about the demo workflows and how users can access and interact with them.

### Data Model

No changes to the existing data model are required for this task. Demo workflows will utilize existing tables and structures.

### API Endpoints

No new API endpoints are required. Existing endpoints will support the creation and execution of demo workflows.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] At least three demo workflows are implemented and accessible through the MeshHook UI.
- [ ] Guided tours for each demo workflow are implemented and provide clear, informative walkthroughs.
- [ ] Demo workflows perform reliably, with execution times meeting the project's performance benchmarks.
- [ ] Documentation is updated to include information on accessing and using demo workflows.

## Dependencies

- Existing MeshHook infrastructure and services must be operational.
- Access to Supabase services for real-time updates and database interactions.

## Implementation Notes

### Development Guidelines

- Follow the existing coding standards and practices established for the MeshHook project.
- Prioritize readability and maintainability, especially since these demos may serve as reference implementations for users.

### Testing Strategy

- Implement unit and integration tests for any new logic introduced as part of the demo workflows.
- Perform manual end-to-end testing of each demo workflow and guided tour to ensure a seamless user experience.

### Security Considerations

- Ensure that demo workflows and guided tours do not expose sensitive information or vulnerabilities.
- Utilize project-scoped secrets and RLS policies as part of the multi-tenant security demo.

### Monitoring & Observability

- Incorporate logging and metrics collection for demo workflow executions to monitor performance and identify potential issues.
