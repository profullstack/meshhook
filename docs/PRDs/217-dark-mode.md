# PRD: Implementation of Dark Mode for MeshHook

## Overview

The objective of implementing a Dark Mode feature is to enhance MeshHook's user experience by providing an alternative theme that reduces eye strain in low-light conditions. This feature aligns with our project goals to improve usability and accessibility for all users, including those who prefer darker color schemes for aesthetic reasons or to extend battery life on OLED displays. By integrating Dark Mode, MeshHook aims to cater to a broader audience, reflecting our commitment to user-centric design and inclusivity.

### Objectives

- Provide an alternative Dark Mode theme across the MeshHook UI.
- Enable users to seamlessly toggle between Dark and Light modes.
- Ensure the Dark Mode design aligns with MeshHook's UI/UX principles and accessibility standards.

## Functional Requirements

1. **User-Controlled Toggle:** Users must have the ability to toggle between Dark and Light modes through a user interface control within the application.
2. **Preference Persistence:** The application should automatically apply the user's last-selected theme preference upon subsequent sessions.
3. **UI Consistency:** Ensure that the Dark Mode theme is consistently implemented across all UI components and pages.
4. **Accessibility and Readability:** The Dark Mode theme must maintain high contrast ratios and readability according to WCAG guidelines.

## Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** Switching between themes must be smooth and instantaneous, with no perceptible delay to the user.
- **Reliability:** Users' theme preferences should be reliably stored and retrieved, ensuring persistence across sessions without loss or corruption.
- **Security:** User preferences for theme selection must be stored securely, preventing unauthorized access or alteration.
- **Maintainability:** The implementation of Dark Mode should follow best practices that allow for easy updates and maintenance of theme-related assets and styles.

## Technical Specifications

### Architecture Context

MeshHook is built using a modern stack that includes SvelteKit for the front end and Supabase for backend services. Implementing a Dark Mode feature requires a thoughtful approach to theme management, ensuring that theme changes do not negatively impact the application's performance or user experience.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Design Phase:**
   - Conduct an audit of current UI components to assess the impact of Dark Mode.
   - Develop a comprehensive color scheme for Dark Mode, ensuring compliance with accessibility standards.
   - Introduce CSS custom properties to facilitate theme switching.
   - Design and implement a user interface control for toggling between themes.

2. **Development Phase:**
   - Implement Dark Mode styles using SASS or CSS-in-JS, leveraging CSS variables for easy theme management.
   - Modify the user profile settings in Supabase to include a theme preference.
   - Utilize SvelteKit's reactive stores to manage and apply the user's theme preference across the application.

3. **Integration & Testing:**
   - Apply Dark Mode styles across all existing UI components and pages.
   - Conduct thorough testing across various devices and browsers to ensure consistent behavior and appearance.
   - Validate accessibility and contrast ratios using automated tools and manual testing.

### Data Model Changes

- No changes to the existing data models are required. However, a new attribute for storing user theme preferences (`theme_preference`) should be added to the `user_settings` table in Supabase.

### API Endpoints

- No new API endpoints are needed. The existing user settings endpoints may be extended to include theme preference as part of the user's profile settings.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Dark Mode theme is consistently implemented across all UI components and pages.
- [ ] Users can toggle between Dark and Light modes using a clearly accessible UI control.
- [ ] User theme preferences are remembered and applied automatically across sessions.
- [ ] The implementation of Dark Mode adheres to accessibility standards.
- [ ] Documentation is updated to include guidelines and considerations for Dark Mode.

## Dependencies

- SvelteKit/Svelte 5 for frontend development.
- Supabase for backend services, including user settings management.
- Existing UI component library for ensuring consistency in design implementation.

## Implementation Notes

### Development Guidelines

- Adhere to the established coding and architectural standards used within the MeshHook project.
- Use CSS variables for theming to ensure maintainability and ease of theme switching.
- Implement a mobile-first design approach to ensure responsiveness across all devices.

### Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests:** Focus on testing the theme switching functionality and user preference storage.
- **Visual Regression Tests:** Ensure that UI components maintain their intended design across theme changes.
- **Accessibility Tests:** Use tools like axe and Lighthouse to test for accessibility compliance in both Light and Dark modes.

### Security Considerations

- Ensure secure handling of user preferences, preventing unauthorized access or modification.
- Validate user input for theme preferences to avoid injection attacks.

### Monitoring & Observability

- Monitor user engagement with the Dark Mode feature to gather insights and identify potential areas for improvement.
- Track performance metrics before and after the implementation of Dark Mode to ensure that it does not negatively impact the application's performance.
