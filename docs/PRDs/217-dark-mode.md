# PRD: Dark Mode Implementation

**Issue:** [#217 Dark mode](https://github.com/profullstack/meshhook/issues/217)  
**Milestone:** Phase 10: Polish & Launch  
**Labels:** ux-improvements, hacktoberfest  
**Owner:** Anthony Ettinger (Profullstack)  
**License:** MIT

## Overview

The implementation of a Dark Mode feature is aimed at enhancing the user experience of the MeshHook workflow engine by providing an alternative, eye-strain-reducing interface that is preferable in low-light conditions. This task aligns with the project's goal to deliver a visually simple and durable workflow engine by improving usability and accessibility for all users.

### Objectives

- Introduce a Dark Mode theme across the MeshHook UI.
- Ensure seamless toggling between Dark and Light modes.
- Align Dark Mode design with existing UI/UX principles and accessibility standards.

## Functional Requirements

1. **Toggle Feature:** Users must be able to toggle between Dark and Light modes from the user interface.
2. **User Preference:** The application should remember the user's theme preference across sessions.
3. **Consistency:** The Dark Mode implementation must be consistent across all UI components.
4. **Accessibility:** Ensure high contrast and readability in Dark Mode.

## Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** Theme switching should be instantaneous without affecting the responsiveness of the application.
- **Reliability:** Dark Mode settings must persist across sessions and not reset unexpectedly.
- **Security:** Implement theme preference storage securely, ensuring user settings integrity.
- **Maintainability:** Theme styles should be easily maintainable and extendable for future adjustments.

## Technical Specifications

### Architecture Context

MeshHook leverages a modern tech stack including SvelteKit for the frontend and Supabase for backend services. The introduction of Dark Mode requires careful consideration of theme management and efficient style switching mechanisms without impacting the existing performance and user experience.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Analysis:** Evaluate current UI components and styles to determine the impact of introducing Dark Mode.
2. **Design:** Define color schemes for Dark Mode, ensuring accessibility and consistency with Light Mode.
   - Utilize CSS custom properties for color themes.
   - Implement a theme switcher component.
3. **Implementation:** Develop Dark Mode styles and theme toggling functionality.
   - Integrate theme preference in the user profile settings stored in Supabase.
   - Use SvelteKit's reactive stores to manage theme state across the application.
4. **Integration:** Apply Dark Mode styles across all UI components and pages.
5. **Testing:** Perform UI testing to ensure consistency and functionality across browsers and devices.
6. **Documentation:** Update the component library and style guides with Dark Mode guidelines.

### Data Model

No changes to the existing data model are required. However, a user preference for theme setting should be stored, likely within an existing user settings table in Supabase.

### API Endpoints

No new API endpoints are required. Existing endpoints related to user settings may be extended to include theme preferences.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Dark Mode is consistently applied across all UI components.
- [ ] Users can toggle between Dark and Light modes seamlessly.
- [ ] User theme preferences are persisted across sessions.
- [ ] Dark Mode implementation adheres to accessibility standards, including contrast and readability.
- [ ] Documentation is updated to include Dark Mode design guidelines and implementation details.

## Dependencies

- SvelteKit/Svelte 5 for frontend development.
- Supabase for backend services and user settings management.
- Existing UI component library and style guides.

## Implementation Notes

### Development Guidelines

- Follow the established coding standards and best practices for SvelteKit.
- Utilize CSS variables for theming to simplify the implementation of Dark Mode.
- Ensure that all new code is covered by automated tests to maintain high code quality.

### Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests:** For theme switching logic and user preference storage.
- **Visual Regression Tests:** To ensure UI consistency across themes.
- **Accessibility Tests:** Verify that Dark Mode meets accessibility standards, using tools like axe or Lighthouse.

### Security Considerations

- Ensure user preferences are securely stored and retrieved without exposing sensitive user information.

### Monitoring & Observability

- Monitor user adoption and preference for Dark Mode to inform future UX improvements.
