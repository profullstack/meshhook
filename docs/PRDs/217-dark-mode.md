# PRD: Implement Dark Mode

## Overview

The goal of this task is to implement a Dark Mode feature in MeshHook, enhancing the user interface (UI) by providing an alternative color scheme that reduces eye strain in low-light conditions and offers a modern aesthetic appeal. This feature aligns with MeshHook's objectives by improving user experience (UX) and accessibility, thereby supporting the project's core goals of delivering a visually simple and durable workflow engine.

**Objective:** Introduce Dark Mode to enhance UX and accessibility.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

1. **Toggle Feature:** Users should be able to toggle Dark Mode on and off manually.
2. **User Preference Storage:** The application should remember the user's Dark Mode preference across sessions.
3. **Automatic Theme Switching (Optional):** Optionally, implement automatic switching between light and dark modes based on the user's system preferences.
4. **Consistent UI Components:** Ensure all UI components are consistently styled across both themes.
5. **Accessibility Compliance:** Ensure contrast ratios meet or exceed WCAG 2.1 AA standards for text and UI components.

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** The theme switch should be seamless without impacting the application's performance.
- **Reliability:** Dark Mode settings should persist across sessions and not reset unexpectedly.
- **Security:** User preferences should be stored securely.
- **Maintainability:** Theme-related code should be modular and easy to update or extend.

## Technical Specifications

### Architecture Context

- **Frontend:** SvelteKit/Svelte 5 for rendering the UI.
- **Backend:** Supabase for user preference storage.
- **Design System:** Ensure theming supports both light and dark modes efficiently.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Design Phase:**
   - Define color schemes for dark and light modes.
   - Update Svelte components to support both themes using CSS custom properties.
2. **Development Phase:**
   - Implement a toggle switch in the UI for users to select their preferred theme.
   - Store the user's theme preference in Supabase (consider using `localStorage` as a fallback).
   - If implementing automatic theme switching, use the `prefers-color-scheme` media query to detect system theme settings.
3. **Integration Testing:**
   - Ensure theme changes are applied consistently across all components.
   - Validate performance to ensure theme switching is seamless.
4. **User Testing:**
   - Conduct user testing to gather feedback on the Dark Mode implementation and make necessary adjustments.

### Data Model Changes

- **User Preferences Table:** Update the schema to include a user preference for the theme if not already present.

    ```sql
    ALTER TABLE user_preferences ADD COLUMN theme VARCHAR(10) DEFAULT 'light' NOT NULL;
    ```

### API Endpoints

- **Update User Preference:** Create or update an endpoint to save the user's theme preference.

    ```http
    PATCH /api/v1/user/preferences
    Content-Type: application/json

    {
      "theme": "dark" // or "light"
    }
    ```

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Users can toggle Dark Mode on and off.
- [ ] The application remembers the user's Dark Mode preference across sessions.
- [ ] All UI components are consistently styled in both themes.
- [ ] Theme switching does not degrade application performance.
- [ ] Contrast ratios meet or exceed WCAG 2.1 AA standards.

## Dependencies

- **UI Framework:** SvelteKit/Svelte 5.
- **Backend:** Supabase for storing user preferences.
- **Design System:** Ensure it supports theming.

## Implementation Notes

### Development Guidelines

- Use CSS custom properties for theming.
- Ensure new UI components are tested in both light and dark modes.
- Follow the project's coding standards and best practices.

### Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests:** For theme switching logic.
- **Integration Tests:** Ensure theme preferences persist and are applied across sessions.
- **Manual Testing:** Conduct user testing for UX feedback.

### Security Considerations

- Ensure user preference updates are authenticated and authorized.

### Monitoring & Observability

- Monitor performance metrics to ensure theme switching does not impact load times or responsiveness.

Implementing Dark Mode in MeshHook will significantly enhance the user experience, catering to a wider audience by providing a visually comfortable and customizable UI.
