# PRD: Implementation of Dark Mode for MeshHook

## 1. Overview

The implementation of Dark Mode in MeshHook is aimed at enhancing the user experience by providing a visually comfortable alternative for users, especially in low-light environments. This feature is in direct response to user feedback and aligns with our ongoing efforts to make MeshHook an accessible and user-friendly platform for workflow automation. Integrating Dark Mode not only caters to user preferences but also contributes to energy efficiency on devices with OLED and AMOLED screens, thereby underscoring our commitment to sustainability. This initiative is part of Phase 10: Polish & Launch, marking a significant milestone in improving the platform's usability and aesthetic appeal.

## 2. Functional Requirements

- **Dark Mode Toggle**: Users must be able to switch between Dark and Light Mode via a toggle accessible within the user settings or directly from the main UI interface.
- **Persistence of User Preference**: MeshHook should remember the user’s theme preference (Dark or Light Mode) across sessions and devices, applying it automatically upon subsequent logins.
- **Consistency Across UI Components**: All UI elements, including menus, buttons, dialogs, and workflow visualizations, should reflect the Dark Mode theme consistently.
- **Accessibility Compliance**: The Dark Mode should adhere to WCAG 2.1 AA standards, ensuring optimal contrast and readability.

## 3. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance**: The theme switch should be instantaneous without causing any noticeable delay or requiring a page refresh.
- **Reliability**: The system must reliably store and apply the user’s theme preference across all sessions and devices without fail.
- **Security**: User preferences for the theme must be securely stored, with mechanisms in place to prevent unauthorized access or modification.
- **Maintainability**: The implementation should be modular and follow best practices to facilitate easy updates and maintenance without impacting existing functionalities.

## 4. Technical Specifications

### Architecture Context

MeshHook is built on a SvelteKit/Svelte 5 frontend and utilizes Supabase for backend services, including authentication and data persistence. The introduction of Dark Mode requires seamless integration with these technologies to ensure consistency and performance.

### Implementation Approach

1. **UI Component and Color Scheme Audit**:
   - Perform a comprehensive review of existing UI components to determine adjustments required for Dark Mode.
   - Define a Dark Mode color palette that complements MeshHook’s design principles.

2. **Theme Preference Management**:
   - Extend the `user_settings` schema in Supabase to include a `theme_preference` attribute.
   - Utilize SvelteKit stores to dynamically manage and apply the user’s theme preference.

3. **Frontend Development**:
   - Implement Dark Mode styles using CSS custom properties for easy transitions between themes.
   - Add a theme toggle within the user settings UI for easy access.

### Data Model Changes

- `user_settings` table modification:
  - Add `theme_preference` ENUM('dark', 'light'), with a default value of 'light'.

### API Endpoints

- Leverage existing user settings API for updating and retrieving `theme_preference`. No new endpoints are required.

## 5. Acceptance Criteria

- Users can toggle between Dark and Light Modes via a switch in the user settings.
- The application remembers the user's theme preference across sessions and devices.
- Dark Mode visuals are consistent across all UI components and meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards.
- Theme switching is swift, with no perceptible delay or need for page reload.

## 6. Dependencies and Prerequisites

- SvelteKit for frontend development.
- Supabase for backend data management.
- Existing MeshHook design system and UI component library.

## 7. Implementation Notes

### Development Guidelines

- Ensure adherence to MeshHook coding standards and best practices.
- Employ CSS custom properties for efficient theme management.
- Test responsiveness across different devices and screen sizes.

### Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests**: Validate the logic for theme switching and preference persistence.
- **Visual Regression Tests**: Confirm that UI components render correctly under both themes.
- **Accessibility Testing**: Utilize aXe or Lighthouse to confirm compliance with WCAG standards.

### Security Considerations

- Securely handle user preferences to prevent unauthorized access or modification.
- Validate user inputs for theme preference changes to avoid injection attacks.

### Monitoring & Observability

- Monitor user engagement with Dark Mode to gather insights for future improvements.
- Implement logging for theme preference changes to aid troubleshooting.

## Definition of Done

- Full implementation, testing, and documentation of the Dark Mode feature, with all changes merged into the main branch.
- Successful deployment to production and passage of all related CI/CD pipelines.
- Collection of initial user feedback post-launch for potential enhancements.
