# PRD: Implementation of Dark Mode for MeshHook

## Overview

The implementation of Dark Mode in MeshHook aims to enhance user experience by offering an alternative, visually subdued theme that reduces eye strain, especially under low-light conditions. This feature is in response to user feedback and aligns with modern UX design trends that prioritize user comfort and accessibility. Incorporating Dark Mode will not only cater to user preferences but also demonstrate MeshHook's commitment to inclusivity and adaptability, thereby supporting broader user engagement.

### Objectives

- To provide an intuitive and seamless Dark Mode experience across the MeshHook platform.
- To ensure Dark Mode adheres to MeshHook's design principles, enhancing visual comfort without compromising functionality.
- To implement Dark Mode in a way that respects user preferences across sessions and devices, contributing to a personalized user experience.

## Functional Requirements

1. **Dark Mode Toggle:** Implement a toggle switch accessible from the user settings or main UI, allowing users to switch between Dark and Light modes.
2. **User Preference Persistence:** Store the user's theme preference (Dark or Light mode) in their profile settings, ensuring the chosen theme persists across sessions and devices.
3. **Consistent UI Implementation:** All components, pages, and functionalities must support Dark Mode, providing a consistent and visually integrated user experience.
4. **Accessibility Compliance:** Ensure Dark Mode meets accessibility standards, offering sufficient contrast and readability.

## Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** Theme switching should be smooth and instant, with minimal impact on application load times or performance.
- **Reliability:** User preferences for Dark Mode must be accurately stored and retrieved, ensuring consistent application behavior.
- **Security:** Securely handle theme preference settings, protecting against unauthorized modifications.
- **Maintainability:** Develop Dark Mode in a modular and scalable manner, facilitating future updates and maintenance with minimal effort.

## Technical Specifications

### Architecture Context

MeshHook utilizes SvelteKit for its frontend and Supabase for backend functionalities. The introduction of Dark Mode requires a systematic approach to theming, ensuring minimal performance impact and seamless integration with existing frontend and backend systems.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Design & Audit:**
   - Perform a UI component and color scheme audit to establish a comprehensive Dark Mode color palette.
   - Design a toggle switch for Dark/Light mode, ensuring it's accessible and intuitive.
   - Use CSS custom properties to manage color schemes, facilitating easy theme switching.

2. **Development:**
   - Extend Supabase `user_settings` to include a `theme_preference` attribute.
   - Utilize SvelteKit's reactive stores for theme state management, enabling real-time theme switching across the application.
   - Implement Dark Mode styles, ensuring consistency and compliance with WCAG contrast ratios.

3. **Testing & Integration:**
   - Conduct cross-browser and device testing to ensure consistent Dark Mode implementation.
   - Perform accessibility testing, verifying compliance with established guidelines.
   - Integrate Dark Mode preference into user profile settings, ensuring persistence across sessions and devices.

### Data Model Changes

- Extend the `user_settings` table in Supabase to include a `theme_preference` column, storing user's theme choice (`'dark'` or `'light'`).

### API Endpoints

- Utilize existing user settings API to incorporate `theme_preference` updates, requiring no additional endpoints but minor modifications to existing ones to handle the new attribute.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Dark Mode is consistently implemented across all UI components without impacting existing functionalities.
- [ ] Users can easily switch between Dark and Light modes, with their preference persisting across sessions and devices.
- [ ] Dark Mode implementation adheres to WCAG 2.1 AA contrast ratios and other accessibility standards.
- [ ] Performance benchmarks pre- and post-Dark Mode implementation show no significant impact on application performance.

## Dependencies

- SvelteKit and Supabase as core technologies.
- Existing UI component library and design system for consistent UI/UX implementation.

## Implementation Notes

### Development Guidelines

- Follow MeshHook's code style and contribution guidelines.
- Implement Dark Mode using CSS variables for efficient theme management.
- Ensure responsive design and test across a wide range of devices.

### Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests:** Verify Dark Mode toggling logic and user preference storage.
- **Integration Tests:** Ensure seamless integration with existing user settings and UI components.
- **Accessibility Tests:** Use tools like WebAIM's Contrast Checker to validate contrast compliance.

### Security Considerations

- Securely handle the update and storage of `theme_preference` to prevent unauthorized access or modification.
- Validate all user inputs related to theme preferences to mitigate potential vulnerabilities.

### Monitoring & Observability

- Monitor user interactions with the Dark Mode toggle to gather insights on usage patterns.
- Track any reported issues or feedback regarding Dark Mode to continuously improve the feature.
