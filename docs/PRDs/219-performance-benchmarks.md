# PRD: Performance Benchmarks for MeshHook

## 1. Overview

### Objective

The primary objective of this initiative is to implement comprehensive performance benchmarks for MeshHook. This task aims to measure, validate, and ensure MeshHook's performance across its core functionalities, including webhook trigger processing, Visual DAG builder responsiveness, durable replayable runs, live logs delivery, and multi-tenant RLS security. By achieving this, we aim to uphold MeshHook's commitment to delivering a high-performance, Postgres-native workflow engine that marries the visual simplicity of n8n with the durability of Temporal, all within a scalable, license-free framework.

### Alignment with Project Goals

Performance benchmarking is pivotal for MeshHook, directly aligning with our goal to provide a robust and efficient workflow engine. It is essential for maintaining high performance and reliability standards, ensuring that MeshHook remains competitive and meets the users' expectations for a fast, responsive, and scalable workflow solution.

## 2. Functional Requirements

1. **Benchmark Development**:
   - Create benchmarks for measuring webhook trigger processing time.
   - Test Visual DAG builder responsiveness and interaction latency.
   - Benchmark workflow execution time across different complexity levels.
   - Measure the latency of live log delivery.
   - Assess the performance impact of MeshHook's multi-tenant RLS security mechanisms.

2. **Automation and Integration**:
   - Develop or utilize automated benchmarking tools for consistent performance evaluation.
   - Integrate performance benchmarks into the MeshHook CI/CD pipeline for continuous performance validation.

3. **Metric Collection and Analysis**:
   - Collect key performance metrics such as response times, throughput, and resource utilization.
   - Analyze these metrics to identify performance bottlenecks and optimization opportunities.

4. **Baseline Metrics and Regression Detection**:
   - Establish baseline performance metrics for MeshHook.
   - Implement mechanisms to detect and notify about performance regressions in future updates.

## 3. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance**: Ensure sub-second latency for user-facing operations and maintain performance under load.
- **Reliability**: Achieve 99.9% uptime for the benchmarking suite and MeshHook components.
- **Security**: Benchmarking must adhere to MeshHook’s security protocols, ensuring no vulnerabilities are introduced.
- **Maintainability**: Ensure benchmarking code and documentation are clear, maintainable, and in line with MeshHook's standards.

## 4. Technical Specifications

### Architecture Context

MeshHook leverages a SvelteKit/Svelte 5 front end, Supabase (including Postgres and Realtime), and worker-based orchestration. The performance benchmarking framework should integrate seamlessly with this setup, targeting critical performance paths without requiring significant architectural changes.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Preliminary Analysis**: Review MeshHook’s architecture and codebase to identify critical performance paths.
2. **Benchmark Design**: Craft detailed benchmark scenarios covering all key components.
3. **Tool Selection and Development**: Choose or develop benchmarking tools for executing scenarios and collecting metrics.
4. **Benchmark Execution**: Run benchmarks, collect data, and establish performance baselines.
5. **Data Analysis and Optimization**: Analyze data, identify bottlenecks, and plan optimizations.
6. **Integration and Automation**: Integrate benchmarks into CI/CD for continuous monitoring.
7. **Documentation**: Document the benchmarking approach, tools, and findings.

### Data Model and API Endpoints

- **Data Model Changes**: None required for benchmark implementation.
- **API Endpoints**: Performance of existing API endpoints will be evaluated; no new endpoints are needed for benchmarking.

## 5. Acceptance Criteria

- Benchmarks implemented for key MeshHook components.
- Benchmarking integrated into the CI/CD process.
- Performance baselines established and documented.
- Identified performance optimizations documented for future implementation.
- Comprehensive documentation of the benchmarking approach and findings.

## 6. Dependencies and Prerequisites

- Access to MeshHook codebase and infrastructure.
- Selection or development of benchmarking tools.
- CI/CD pipeline access.

## 7. Implementation Notes

### Development Guidelines

- Use modern JavaScript and MeshHook's coding standards.
- Ensure benchmark code is well-documented and maintainable.
- Apply Test-Driven Development (TDD) where feasible.

### Testing Strategy

- Conduct thorough benchmark testing to ensure accurate performance metrics.
- Verify that optimizations do not introduce regressions or degrade performance.

### Security Considerations

- Conduct benchmarking securely, in compliance with MeshHook's security protocols.
- Be cautious with sensitive data during benchmarking.

### Monitoring and Observability

- Implement detailed logging for benchmarks to aid analysis and optimization.
- Monitor system performance and resource utilization during benchmarking.

Adhering to this PRD will ensure that MeshHook establishes a solid performance foundation, identifies and addresses optimization areas, and integrates a continuous performance evaluation framework, setting the stage for a successful launch and scalable future.
