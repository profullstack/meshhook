# PRD: Performance Benchmarks for MeshHook

## Overview

**Task Objective:** Implement performance benchmarks for MeshHook, focusing on ensuring the engine meets its performance goals in alignment with the project's core functionalities. This task is crucial for validating MeshHook's efficiency, scalability, and reliability, emphasizing aspects like webhook triggers processing, DAG builder responsiveness, durable, replayable runs, live logs delivery, and multi-tenant RLS security performance.

**Alignment with Project Goals:** Performance benchmarking directly supports MeshHook’s mission by guaranteeing high-performance standards across all features. This initiative aims to uphold MeshHook's promise of delivering a robust, Postgres-native workflow engine that combines the visual simplicity of n8n with Temporal's durability, all within a flexible, license-free package.

## Functional Requirements

1. **Benchmark Development:** Design and implement benchmarks that accurately measure the performance of:
   - Webhook trigger processing time.
   - Visual DAG builder responsiveness and interaction latency.
   - Workflow execution time across various complexity levels.
   - Real-time live log delivery latency.
   - Performance impact of multi-tenant RLS security mechanisms.

2. **Automation and Integration:** Develop automated benchmarking scripts or utilize existing tools for consistent performance evaluation. Integrate these benchmarks into MeshHook's CI/CD pipeline for ongoing performance validation.

3. **Metric Collection and Analysis:** Collect essential performance metrics such as response times, throughput, CPU/memory usage, and error rates. Analyze these metrics to identify bottlenecks and areas for optimization.

4. **Baseline Metrics and Regression Detection:** Establish baseline performance metrics for the current system state. Implement mechanisms to detect and alert on performance regressions in future code changes or additions.

## Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** MeshHook should maintain sub-second latency for all user-facing operations and handle a predetermined load threshold without performance degradation.
- **Reliability:** Target 99.9% uptime for the benchmarking process and MeshHook components, with robust error handling and recovery strategies.
- **Security:** Ensure that the benchmarking activities comply with MeshHook’s security standards, safeguarding against potential vulnerabilities.
- **Maintainability:** Write clear, maintainable benchmarking code and documentation that adheres to MeshHook’s coding and architectural standards.

## Technical Specifications

### Architecture Context

MeshHook is built with a SvelteKit front end and a Supabase-powered back end, including Postgres for data storage and queue management, and Realtime for live log updates. The architecture leverages workers for orchestration and execution tasks. The performance benchmarking should integrate with this existing architecture seamlessly, requiring minimal modifications.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Preliminary Analysis:** Review the MeshHook codebase and architecture to identify critical performance measurement points.
2. **Benchmark Design:** Define detailed benchmark scenarios that cover all critical components and interactions within MeshHook.
3. **Tool Selection and Development:** Select appropriate benchmarking tools or develop custom scripts for executing the benchmarks and collecting data.
4. **Benchmark Execution:** Run the benchmarks against MeshHook to gather initial performance data and establish a performance baseline.
5. **Data Analysis and Optimization:** Analyze the collected performance data to identify bottlenecks and areas for optimization. Implement necessary optimizations.
6. **Integration and Automation:** Integrate the benchmarks into the CI/CD pipeline for ongoing performance monitoring and regression detection.
7. **Documentation:** Document the benchmarking process, tools, and findings for future reference and ongoing optimization efforts.

### Data Model and API Endpoints

- **Data Model Changes:** No changes to the existing data model are required for the implementation of performance benchmarks.
- **API Endpoints:** While no new API endpoints are required for benchmarking, existing endpoints related to the benchmarked components will be evaluated for performance.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Benchmarks designed and implemented for critical MeshHook components and features.
- Automated benchmarking process integrated into the CI/CD pipeline.
- Baseline performance metrics established and documented.
- Performance optimizations identified and outlined for future implementation.
- Documentation of the benchmarking process, tools, and initial findings completed.

## Dependencies and Prerequisites

- Access to MeshHook’s existing codebase and deployment infrastructure.
- Selection or development of benchmarking tools/scripts.
- CI/CD pipeline access for integration purposes.

## Implementation Notes

### Development Guidelines

- Utilize modern JavaScript features and the ESM module system as per MeshHook standards.
- Ensure the benchmarking code is clean, well-documented, and follows the project’s coding conventions.
- Adopt Test-Driven Development (TDD) practices where applicable.

### Testing Strategy

- Perform thorough benchmark testing to ensure accurate performance measurement.
- Ensure new code or optimizations do not introduce functionality regressions or performance degradations.

### Security Considerations

- Ensure all benchmarking activities are conducted securely, maintaining compliance with MeshHook's security guidelines.
- Pay special attention to the handling of sensitive data during the benchmarking process.

### Monitoring and Observability

- Implement detailed logging for benchmark runs to assist with data analysis and optimization efforts.
- Monitor resource usage and system performance during benchmarking to identify potential infrastructure impacts.

By following this PRD, MeshHook will establish a solid performance baseline, identify areas for optimization, and integrate a framework for ongoing performance evaluation, ensuring MeshHook’s readiness for a successful launch and future scalability.
