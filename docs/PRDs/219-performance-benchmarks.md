# PRD: Performance Benchmarks for MeshHook

## 1. Overview

### Objective

The objective is to establish a robust performance benchmarking framework for MeshHook, ensuring it meets the high-performance standards required for webhook processing, workflow execution, and multi-tenant security. This will involve measuring key performance indicators (KPIs) across MeshHook's core functionalities to identify and address potential bottlenecks, thereby guaranteeing a seamless, scalable experience for end-users.

### Alignment with Project Goals

This initiative directly supports MeshHook's commitment to providing a high-performance, visually intuitive, and durable workflow engine. By rigorously benchmarking and optimizing performance, MeshHook will not only meet but exceed user expectations for responsiveness and reliability, reinforcing its position as a leading open-source workflow solution.

## 2. Functional Requirements

1. **Benchmark Development**:
   - Develop benchmarks for webhook trigger processing, focusing on minimal latency and high throughput.
   - Benchmark the responsiveness of the Visual DAG builder, ensuring low interaction latency.
   - Measure workflow execution times, catering to various levels of complexity and size.
   - Evaluate the performance of live log delivery, aiming for real-time updates with minimal delay.
   - Test the efficiency of MeshHook's multi-tenant RLS security, ensuring security measures do not significantly impact performance.

2. **Automation and Integration**:
   - Utilize automated benchmarking tools capable of simulating real-world usage patterns.
   - Integrate these benchmarks within the MeshHook CI/CD pipeline, facilitating continuous performance monitoring.

3. **Metric Collection and Analysis**:
   - Collect comprehensive performance metrics, including but not limited to execution times, resource usage, and throughput.
   - Systematically analyze these metrics to pinpoint performance inefficiencies and opportunities for optimization.

4. **Baseline Metrics and Regression Detection**:
   - Establish a set of baseline performance metrics for future comparisons.
   - Implement an automated regression detection system to alert developers of performance degradation.

## 3. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance**: Achieve and maintain sub-second response times for user-facing operations, even under high load conditions.
- **Reliability**: Ensure that the benchmarking suite and all MeshHook components maintain at least a 99.9% uptime.
- **Security**: Conduct all benchmarking activities in accordance with MeshHook's stringent security protocols, ensuring no new vulnerabilities are introduced.
- **Maintainability**: Ensure that all benchmarking code, tools, and documentation are straightforward, well-organized, and in alignment with MeshHook's coding standards.

## 4. Technical Specifications

### Architecture Context

MeshHook is built on a SvelteKit/Svelte 5 front end and utilizes Supabase for Postgres and real-time functionalities. The performance benchmarks should seamlessly fit into this architecture, emphasizing the evaluation of MeshHook's webhook processing, DAG builder responsiveness, and overall workflow execution efficiency.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Preliminary Analysis**: Conduct a thorough review of MeshHook’s codebase and architecture to identify critical paths affecting performance.
2. **Benchmark Design**: Design comprehensive benchmark tests that cover all key MeshHook functionalities.
3. **Tool Selection and Development**: Identify existing benchmarking tools that can be adapted for MeshHook’s needs or develop bespoke tools if necessary.
4. **Benchmark Execution**: Execute the designed benchmarks, collecting detailed performance data.
5. **Data Analysis and Optimization**: Analyze the collected data to identify bottlenecks and plan for necessary optimizations.
6. **Integration and Automation**: Integrate the benchmarks into the CI/CD pipeline for ongoing performance monitoring.
7. **Documentation**: Thoroughly document the benchmarking process, tools used, and findings for transparency and future reference.

### Data Model and API Endpoints

- **Data Model Changes**: No changes to the data model are needed specifically for benchmarking.
- **API Endpoints**: Existing API endpoints' performance will be evaluated; no new endpoints are required for benchmarking purposes.

## 5. Acceptance Criteria

- Benchmarks for all key components are implemented and documented.
- Benchmarking results are integrated into the CI/CD process for ongoing monitoring.
- Performance baselines are established, documented, and compared against subsequent performance metrics.
- Potential performance optimizations are identified and detailed for future implementation.
- Benchmarking methodology, tools, and results are well-documented.

## 6. Dependencies and Prerequisites

- Full access to the MeshHook codebase and deployment infrastructure.
- Appropriate benchmarking tools, whether open-source or custom-developed.
- Integration capabilities with the existing CI/CD pipeline.

## 7. Implementation Notes

### Development Guidelines

- Adhere to modern JavaScript best practices and MeshHook's existing coding standards.
- Ensure that all benchmarking code is clean, well-commented, and maintainable.
- Where applicable, apply Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles to benchmarking code development.

### Testing Strategy

- Perform comprehensive testing of benchmarks to validate their accuracy and reliability.
- Ensure that performance optimizations are tested to confirm they do not introduce regressions or negatively impact other functionalities.

### Security Considerations

- Execute all benchmarking in a secure manner, fully compliant with MeshHook’s security guidelines.
- Treat any sensitive data with the highest security standards during benchmark testing.

### Monitoring and Observability

- Implement detailed logging for all benchmarking activities to facilitate thorough analysis and troubleshooting.
- Monitor system performance and resource utilization closely during benchmark tests to identify any unexpected behavior or impact.

Following this PRD will enable MeshHook to solidify its performance foundation, streamline future development with continuous performance feedback, and maintain its commitment to delivering a high-quality, efficient workflow solution.
