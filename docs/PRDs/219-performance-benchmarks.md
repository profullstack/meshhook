# PRD: Performance Benchmarks for MeshHook

## Overview

**Purpose:** This document specifies the requirements for implementing performance benchmarks in MeshHook, a webhook-first, deterministic, Postgres-native workflow engine. This task is crucial for ensuring that MeshHook meets its performance goals, aligns with its commitment to reliability, and provides a robust foundation for its users. The performance benchmarks will be instrumental in identifying bottlenecks, optimizing resource usage, and validating the system's scalability and efficiency as we move towards the launch.

**Alignment with Project Goals:** The performance benchmarks directly support MeshHook’s objectives by ensuring webhook triggers, the visual DAG builder, durable runs, live logs, and multi-tenant security are delivered with optimal performance and reliability. This task is in line with our goals to offer a solution that combines n8n's visual simplicity and Temporal's durability in a lightweight, license-unencumbered package.

## Functional Requirements

1. **Benchmark Design:** Design comprehensive benchmarks to measure the performance of key components:
   - Webhook triggers processing time.
   - DAG builder responsiveness.
   - Run execution time for workflows of varying complexity.
   - Live log update latency.
   - Multi-tenant RLS security overhead.
2. **Automation:** Implement scripts or use benchmarking tools to automate the performance testing process, allowing for regular and consistent performance evaluations.
3. **Metric Collection:** Collect relevant metrics, including response times, throughput, resource usage (CPU, memory), and error rates.
4. **Baseline Establishment:** Establish baseline performance metrics for current implementation to identify improvement areas and track performance over time.
5. **Regression Detection:** Integrate performance benchmarks into the CI/CD pipeline to detect performance regressions automatically.

## Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** Ensure that all user-facing operations complete within sub-second response times and that the system can handle a predefined throughput threshold without degradation.
- **Reliability:** Achieve 99.9% uptime for all components involved in the benchmarking process, with comprehensive error handling and recovery mechanisms in place.
- **Security:** Adhere to MeshHook's security guidelines, ensuring that benchmarking processes do not expose vulnerabilities.
- **Maintainability:** Structure benchmark code and documentation clearly and concisely, adhering to project standards for easy maintenance and updates.

## Technical Specifications

### Architecture Context

MeshHook utilizes a combination of SvelteKit for the frontend and Supabase (Postgres, Realtime) for backend operations, with workers handling orchestration and execution. The performance benchmarking must integrate seamlessly with this setup, requiring minimal to no modifications to the existing architecture.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Analysis:** Evaluate existing components (webhook triggers, DAG builder, etc.) to define key performance indicators (KPIs).
2. **Design Benchmarks:** Outline detailed benchmarks, including scenarios, expected metrics, and success criteria.
3. **Tool Selection:** Choose appropriate tools or scripts for running benchmarks and collecting data.
4. **Implementation:** Develop the benchmark tests, ensuring they are repeatable and cover a wide range of scenarios.
5. **Integration:** Integrate benchmarks into the CI/CD pipeline for automated regression detection.
6. **Execution:** Run benchmarks to collect baseline data and identify initial performance bottlenecks.
7. **Optimization:** Based on benchmark results, optimize code and architecture as necessary.
8. **Documentation:** Document benchmarking processes, tools, and initial baseline metrics for future reference.

### Data Model

No changes to the existing data model are required for the implementation of performance benchmarks.

### API Endpoints

No new API endpoints are required. However, existing endpoints related to the components being benchmarked should be documented with their expected performance metrics.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Benchmark tests designed and implemented for all specified components.
- [ ] Automated benchmark scripts or tools are in place and documented.
- [ ] Baseline performance metrics established and documented.
- [ ] Performance optimizations identified and documented for future implementation.
- [ ] Benchmarks integrated into the CI/CD pipeline with automated regression alerts.
- [ ] No degradation in existing functionality or performance post-optimization.

## Dependencies and Prerequisites

- Access to the current MeshHook codebase and infrastructure.
- Benchmarking tools or scripts, as identified during the tool selection phase.
- CI/CD pipeline access for integrating performance benchmarks.

## Implementation Notes

### Development Guidelines

- Utilize ESM module system and modern JavaScript features as per MeshHook standards.
- Ensure code is well-commented, especially regarding benchmark parameters and expected outcomes.
- Follow TDD practices where applicable, particularly for new utility functions introduced for benchmarking.

### Testing Strategy

- **Benchmark Testing:** Ensure each benchmark reliably measures the intended metrics and can be executed repeatedly with consistent results.
- **Regression Testing:** Verify that performance benchmarks do not introduce regressions or adversely affect existing functionality.

### Security Considerations

- Ensure benchmarking data, especially involving live logs or multi-tenant scenarios, is handled securely and complies with MeshHook’s privacy and security standards.

### Monitoring & Observability

- Incorporate logging for benchmark runs to facilitate debugging and optimization.
- Monitor system performance and resource usage during benchmark runs to identify potential bottlenecks or resource constraints.

By adhering to this PRD, the MeshHook team can ensure the platform meets its performance objectives, providing a robust, efficient, and scalable solution for its users. This document will serve as a guiding framework for implementing and validating performance benchmarks, leading to a successful launch and future growth.
