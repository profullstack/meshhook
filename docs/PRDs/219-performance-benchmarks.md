# PRD: Performance Benchmarks for MeshHook

## Overview

<<<<<<< HEAD
**Task Objective:** Implement performance benchmarks for MeshHook, focusing on ensuring the engine meets its performance goals in alignment with the project's core functionalities. This task is crucial for validating MeshHook's efficiency, scalability, and reliability, emphasizing aspects like webhook triggers processing, DAG builder responsiveness, durable, replayable runs, live logs delivery, and multi-tenant RLS security performance.

**Alignment with Project Goals:** Performance benchmarking directly supports MeshHook’s mission by guaranteeing high-performance standards across all features. This initiative aims to uphold MeshHook's promise of delivering a robust, Postgres-native workflow engine that combines the visual simplicity of n8n with Temporal's durability, all within a flexible, license-free package.

## Functional Requirements

1. **Benchmark Development:** Design and implement benchmarks that accurately measure the performance of:
   - Webhook trigger processing time.
   - Visual DAG builder responsiveness and interaction latency.
   - Workflow execution time across various complexity levels.
   - Real-time live log delivery latency.
   - Performance impact of multi-tenant RLS security mechanisms.

2. **Automation and Integration:** Develop automated benchmarking scripts or utilize existing tools for consistent performance evaluation. Integrate these benchmarks into MeshHook's CI/CD pipeline for ongoing performance validation.

3. **Metric Collection and Analysis:** Collect essential performance metrics such as response times, throughput, CPU/memory usage, and error rates. Analyze these metrics to identify bottlenecks and areas for optimization.

4. **Baseline Metrics and Regression Detection:** Establish baseline performance metrics for the current system state. Implement mechanisms to detect and alert on performance regressions in future code changes or additions.

## Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** MeshHook should maintain sub-second latency for all user-facing operations and handle a predetermined load threshold without performance degradation.
- **Reliability:** Target 99.9% uptime for the benchmarking process and MeshHook components, with robust error handling and recovery strategies.
- **Security:** Ensure that the benchmarking activities comply with MeshHook’s security standards, safeguarding against potential vulnerabilities.
- **Maintainability:** Write clear, maintainable benchmarking code and documentation that adheres to MeshHook’s coding and architectural standards.
=======
**Purpose:** This document specifies the requirements for implementing performance benchmarks in MeshHook, a webhook-first, deterministic, Postgres-native workflow engine. This task is crucial for ensuring that MeshHook meets its performance goals, aligns with its commitment to reliability, and provides a robust foundation for its users. The performance benchmarks will be instrumental in identifying bottlenecks, optimizing resource usage, and validating the system's scalability and efficiency as we move towards the launch.

**Alignment with Project Goals:** The performance benchmarks directly support MeshHook’s objectives by ensuring webhook triggers, the visual DAG builder, durable runs, live logs, and multi-tenant security are delivered with optimal performance and reliability. This task is in line with our goals to offer a solution that combines n8n's visual simplicity and Temporal's durability in a lightweight, license-unencumbered package.

## Functional Requirements

1. **Benchmark Design:** Design comprehensive benchmarks to measure the performance of key components:
   - Webhook triggers processing time.
   - DAG builder responsiveness.
   - Run execution time for workflows of varying complexity.
   - Live log update latency.
   - Multi-tenant RLS security overhead.
2. **Automation:** Implement scripts or use benchmarking tools to automate the performance testing process, allowing for regular and consistent performance evaluations.
3. **Metric Collection:** Collect relevant metrics, including response times, throughput, resource usage (CPU, memory), and error rates.
4. **Baseline Establishment:** Establish baseline performance metrics for current implementation to identify improvement areas and track performance over time.
5. **Regression Detection:** Integrate performance benchmarks into the CI/CD pipeline to detect performance regressions automatically.

## Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** Ensure that all user-facing operations complete within sub-second response times and that the system can handle a predefined throughput threshold without degradation.
- **Reliability:** Achieve 99.9% uptime for all components involved in the benchmarking process, with comprehensive error handling and recovery mechanisms in place.
- **Security:** Adhere to MeshHook's security guidelines, ensuring that benchmarking processes do not expose vulnerabilities.
- **Maintainability:** Structure benchmark code and documentation clearly and concisely, adhering to project standards for easy maintenance and updates.

## Technical Specifications

### Architecture Context

<<<<<<< HEAD
MeshHook is built with a SvelteKit front end and a Supabase-powered back end, including Postgres for data storage and queue management, and Realtime for live log updates. The architecture leverages workers for orchestration and execution tasks. The performance benchmarking should integrate with this existing architecture seamlessly, requiring minimal modifications.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Preliminary Analysis:** Review the MeshHook codebase and architecture to identify critical performance measurement points.
2. **Benchmark Design:** Define detailed benchmark scenarios that cover all critical components and interactions within MeshHook.
3. **Tool Selection and Development:** Select appropriate benchmarking tools or develop custom scripts for executing the benchmarks and collecting data.
4. **Benchmark Execution:** Run the benchmarks against MeshHook to gather initial performance data and establish a performance baseline.
5. **Data Analysis and Optimization:** Analyze the collected performance data to identify bottlenecks and areas for optimization. Implement necessary optimizations.
6. **Integration and Automation:** Integrate the benchmarks into the CI/CD pipeline for ongoing performance monitoring and regression detection.
7. **Documentation:** Document the benchmarking process, tools, and findings for future reference and ongoing optimization efforts.

### Data Model and API Endpoints

- **Data Model Changes:** No changes to the existing data model are required for the implementation of performance benchmarks.
