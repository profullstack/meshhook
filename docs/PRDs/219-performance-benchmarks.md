# PRD: Performance Benchmarks for MeshHook

## 1. Overview

### Objective

The primary objective is to establish a comprehensive performance benchmarking system for MeshHook that ensures its components meet and exceed the required performance standards for webhook processing, workflow execution, and multi-tenant security operations. This will enable the identification and elimination of bottlenecks, ensuring MeshHook's architecture can scale efficiently to handle growing user demands.

### Alignment with Project Goals

This benchmarking initiative is aligned with MeshHook's overarching goal to deliver a high-performance, durable, and visually intuitive workflow engine. By implementing a robust performance benchmarking framework, MeshHook aims to enhance user satisfaction, improve reliability, and uphold its commitment to being a leading open-source workflow solution in the market.

## 2. Functional Requirements

1. **Benchmark Development**:
   - Develop benchmarks to evaluate the performance of webhook trigger processing, focusing on achieving minimal latency and high throughput capabilities.
   - Benchmark the Visual DAG builder for responsiveness and interaction latency under various load conditions.
   - Design workflow execution time benchmarks that cater to diverse complexities and sizes, ensuring efficient execution across all scenarios.
   - Establish benchmarks for live log delivery performance, prioritizing real-time updates with minimal latency.
   - Assess the performance impact of MeshHook's multi-tenant RLS security model, ensuring that security mechanisms do not adversely affect overall performance.

2. **Automation and Integration**:
   - Implement automated benchmarking tools that simulate real-world usage scenarios to accurately measure MeshHook's performance.
   - Integrate benchmarking processes within MeshHook's CI/CD pipeline to enable continuous performance evaluation and monitoring.

3. **Metric Collection and Analysis**:
   - Systematically collect a wide range of performance metrics, including execution times, resource consumption, throughput rates, and more.
   - Analyze collected metrics to identify areas of inefficiency, potential bottlenecks, and opportunities for performance optimization.

4. **Baseline Metrics and Regression Detection**:
   - Establish baseline performance metrics for all critical MeshHook functionalities.
   - Implement an automated system for detecting performance regressions, alerting the development team to any deviations from the established baselines.

## 3. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance**: MeshHook must achieve and consistently maintain sub-second response times for all user-facing operations, even under peak load conditions.
- **Reliability**: The benchmarking suite, along with all MeshHook components, should demonstrate a minimum of 99.9% uptime.
- **Security**: Ensure that benchmarking activities adhere to MeshHook's security protocols, preventing the introduction of new vulnerabilities.
- **Maintainability**: Benchmarking code, documentation, and tools must be clearly organized, easily understandable, and maintain MeshHook’s coding standards for future enhancements.

## 4. Technical Specifications

### Architecture Context

MeshHook leverages a SvelteKit/Svelte 5 frontend and utilizes Supabase for real-time functionalities and Postgres operations. The performance benchmarks must integrate seamlessly with this existing architecture, focusing on webhook processing efficiency, DAG builder responsiveness, and workflow execution performance.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Preliminary Analysis**: Conduct an in-depth analysis of MeshHook's codebase and architecture to identify performance-critical paths.
2. **Benchmark Design**: Create detailed benchmark tests covering all essential MeshHook functionalities.
3. **Tool Selection and Development**: Choose or develop benchmarking tools tailored to MeshHook’s specific needs.
4. **Benchmark Execution**: Run benchmarks to gather extensive performance data.
5. **Data Analysis and Optimization**: Analyze data to locate performance bottlenecks and outline optimization strategies.
6. **Integration and Automation**: Ensure benchmarks are integrated into the CI/CD pipeline for regular performance assessment.
7. **Documentation**: Document the benchmarking methodology, tools, and outcomes comprehensively.

### Data Model and API Endpoints

- **Data Model Changes**: No specific changes to the data model are required for the benchmarking processes.
- **API Endpoints**: Current API endpoints' performance will be assessed; no additional endpoints are needed for benchmarking activities.

## 5. Acceptance Criteria

- Benchmarks for key components are successfully implemented and documented.
- Integration of benchmark results into the CI/CD pipeline for continuous performance monitoring is achieved.
- Performance baselines are established, with comparative analysis against new metrics.
- Identification and documentation of performance optimization opportunities.
- Comprehensive documentation of the benchmarking process, tools, and findings.

## 6. Dependencies and Prerequisites

- Complete access to the MeshHook codebase and deployment infrastructure.
- Selection or development of appropriate benchmarking tools.
- Capability to integrate benchmarking results within the current CI/CD pipeline.

## 7. Implementation Notes

### Development Guidelines

- Follow modern JavaScript best practices and adhere to MeshHook's coding standards.
- Benchmarking code must be clean, maintainable, and accompanied by detailed comments.
- Apply Test-Driven Development (TDD) principles where applicable to the development of benchmarking code.

### Testing Strategy

- Ensure benchmarks are rigorously tested for accuracy and reliability.
- Validate that performance optimizations do not introduce regressions or negatively affect other functionalities.

### Security Considerations

- Conduct benchmarking in alignment with MeshHook's security guidelines, ensuring the protection of sensitive data throughout the testing process.

### Monitoring and Observability

- Implement detailed logging for benchmarking activities to support in-depth analysis and troubleshooting.
- Closely monitor system performance and resource usage during benchmark tests to detect any unexpected issues or impacts.

Adhering to this PRD will lay a solid foundation for MeshHook's performance capabilities, enabling continuous performance improvements and ensuring the platform remains highly efficient and scalable.
