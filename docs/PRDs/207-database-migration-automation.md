# PRD: Database Migration Automation
<<<<<<< HEAD

**Issue:** [#207 Database Migration Automation](https://github.com/profullstack/meshhook/issues/207)  
**Milestone:** Phase 9: Deployment & Operations  
**Labels:** cicd, hacktoberfest  
**Project:** MeshHook  

## 1. Overview

As MeshHook transitions into a more mature phase of deployment and operations, automating database migrations becomes pivotal. This process is essential for applying consistent database schema changes across different environments without manual intervention, thereby maintaining the integrity, reliability, and security of the data layer. This task aligns with MeshHook's foundational goals of providing a robust, scalable, and secure workflow engine.

### Purpose

The purpose of this task is to automate the process of database migrations within the MeshHook project, ensuring that schema changes are seamlessly integrated into the CI/CD pipeline, reducing the risk of human error and enhancing the project's operational efficiency.

## 2. Functional Requirements

1. **Automated Migration Script Generation:** Develop a system to automatically generate migration scripts for database schema changes.
2. **Version Control Integration:** Ensure that all migration scripts are version-controlled to track and manage schema changes across all environments.
3. **CI/CD Pipeline Execution:** Integrate the execution of migration scripts into the CI/CD pipeline, ensuring migrations are automatically applied during deployment.
4. **Rollback Capabilities:** Implement a robust rollback mechanism to revert to the previous stable state in case of migration failure.
5. **Notification and Reporting:** Develop a notification system to inform the development team about the success or failure of migrations.

## 3. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** Migration processes must be optimized to minimize downtime and not impact the overall performance of the application.
- **Reliability:** The migration system should automatically handle errors and provide a reliable rollback mechanism to prevent data loss.
- **Security:** Ensure migration scripts and processes adhere to MeshHook's stringent security guidelines, including the handling of sensitive data.
- **Maintainability:** The migration framework should be easily maintainable, with clear documentation and adherence to MeshHook's coding standards.

## 4. Technical Specifications

### Architecture Context

MeshHook uses a Postgres-native architecture, with SvelteKit/Svelte 5 for frontend operations and Supabase for backend services. The database migration automation must integrate with these technologies, with a particular focus on:

- **Supabase Postgres:** For direct interaction with the MeshHook database.
- **GitHub Actions:** For integrating migration scripts execution into the CI/CD pipeline.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Initial Setup:** Configure a database migration tool (e.g., Flyway or Liquibase) that is compatible with Postgres and supports the required automation features.
2. **Migration Scripts:** Develop a process to automatically generate or write migration scripts for schema changes. Scripts must be idempotent.
3. **CI/CD Integration:** Configure GitHub Actions (or equivalent) to automatically execute migration scripts as part of the deployment process.
4. **Rollback and Error Handling:** Implement error detection and a rollback system for migrations. Ensure that failed migrations trigger notifications and do not proceed to deployment.
5. **Monitoring and Notifications:** Set up a monitoring and notification system to inform the development team about the migration process's outcome.

### Data Model Changes

- **Migration Logs Table:** Introduce a new table to log executed migrations, including details like script name, execution date, status, and any errors encountered.

## Overview

In the deployment and operations phase of MeshHook, a critical requirement is to automate the process of database migrations. This task aligns with MeshHook’s goal to provide a robust, scalable, and secure workflow engine by ensuring that database schema changes are seamlessly applied across environments without manual intervention. Automating database migrations is crucial for maintaining data integrity, reducing downtime, and facilitating continuous delivery.

## Objectives

- To automate the application of database migrations as part of the CI/CD pipeline.
- To ensure database schema changes are version-controlled and applied consistently across all environments.
- To minimize the risk of data loss or schema conflicts during deployment.

## Functional Requirements

1. **Migration Script Generation:** Automatically generate migration scripts based on schema changes.
2. **Version Control for Migrations:** Integrate migration scripts into the version control system to track and apply schema changes.
3. **Automated Migration Execution:** Execute migration scripts automatically as part of the CI/CD pipeline during deployment.
4. **Rollback Mechanism:** Provide a mechanism to rollback failed migrations to the previous stable state.
5. **Notification System:** Notify the development team of the outcome of the migration process.

## Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** Ensure migration scripts are executed efficiently with minimal impact on application availability.
- **Reliability:** Automate error detection and rollback to prevent data loss or corruption.
- **Security:** Ensure that migration scripts do not expose sensitive data and comply with MeshHook’s security guidelines.
- **Maintainability:** Migration scripts and processes should be easy to maintain and update by the development team.

## Technical Specifications

### Architecture Context

MeshHook utilizes a Postgres-native architecture with components deployed across SvelteKit for frontend operations and Supabase for backend services. The database migration automation needs to integrate seamlessly with:

- **Supabase Postgres:** For executing migration scripts against the MeshHook database.
- **CI/CD Pipelines:** Integration with GitHub Actions (or similar) to trigger migrations as part of deployment.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Evaluation of Existing Schema:** Analyze the current database schema and configurations to establish a baseline for migrations.
2. **Tool Selection:** Choose an appropriate database migration tool that integrates with Postgres and supports automation (e.g., Flyway, Liquibase).
3. **Migration Script Development:** Develop migration scripts for schema changes. These scripts should be idempotent to ensure they can be safely rerun.
4. **Integration with CI/CD:** Configure the CI/CD pipeline to automatically trigger the migration process during the deployment phase.
5. **Testing:** Test the migration process in a staging environment to ensure safety and reliability.
6. **Monitoring and Notification:** Implement monitoring to track the status of migrations and set up notifications for the development team.
