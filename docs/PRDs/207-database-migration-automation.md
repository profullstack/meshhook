# PRD: Database Migration Automation for MeshHook

## 1. Overview

### Purpose

The purpose of the Database Migration Automation task is to streamline the process of applying schema changes across different environments of the MeshHook project. This task is crucial for maintaining data integrity, minimizing downtime, and enhancing operational efficiency as MeshHook evolves. By automating this process, we aim to reduce the risk of human error and ensure that our database schema changes are applied consistently and reliably, in line with MeshHook's goals of robustness, scalability, and security.

### Alignment with Project Goals

Automating database migrations directly supports MeshHook's core objectives by:
- Enhancing the reliability and stability of the application.
- Reducing operational overhead and the potential for errors during deployments.
- Ensuring a secure and controlled method of applying database changes.

## 2. Functional Requirements

1. **Automated Migration Scripts Generation:** Implement a system that automatically generates or assists in the generation of migration scripts based on detected schema changes.
2. **Version Control for Migration Scripts:** Integrate migration scripts into a version control system to track changes over time and across different environments.
3. **Automated Execution within CI/CD Workflows:** Configure the CI/CD pipeline (using GitHub Actions) to automatically execute migration scripts as part of the deployment process.
4. **Rollback Mechanisms:** Develop a reliable method for rolling back applied migrations in case of errors or failures, ensuring system stability.
5. **Notification System for Migration Events:** Establish a notification system to alert the development team of the outcome of each migration attempt, whether successful or failed.

## 3. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** Migration scripts should be optimized to execute as quickly as possible to minimize application downtime.
- **Reliability:** The migration process must handle errors gracefully and provide a clear rollback path to ensure system stability.
- **Security:** All aspects of the migration process must adhere to MeshHook's strict security standards, particularly in handling sensitive information.
- **Maintainability:** The migration system should be designed for ease of maintenance, with clear documentation and compatibility with MeshHook's existing technologies.

## 4. Technical Specifications

### Architecture Context

Given MeshHook's reliance on Postgres and its integration with SvelteKit/Svelte 5 and Supabase, the database migration automation process must seamlessly fit into this ecosystem. Key considerations include:

- **Supabase Postgres:** Direct interaction for applying migrations.
- **GitHub Actions:** Leveraging for CI/CD pipeline integration to automate migration script execution.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Selection of Migration Tool:** Choose a database migration tool compatible with Postgres (e.g., Flyway, Liquibase) that supports the required automation features.
2. **Migration Script Management:** Establish a process for generating, reviewing, and managing migration scripts, ensuring they are idempotent and version-controlled.
3. **CI/CD Pipeline Configuration:** Integrate the selected migration tool into the GitHub Actions workflow to automatically apply migrations during deployment processes.
4. **Rollback and Error Handling:** Implement error detection mechanisms with a reliable rollback strategy. Failed migrations should trigger alerts and halt further deployment steps.
5. **Monitoring and Alerting:** Configure a monitoring system to track migration success/failure and alert the development team accordingly.

### Data Model Changes

- **Migration Logs Table:** Create a new table within the MeshHook database to record details of each migration attempt, including script identifiers, execution timestamps, outcomes, and error messages if any.

### API Endpoints

N/A - This initiative focuses on backend processes and does not directly involve new API endpoints.

## 5. Acceptance Criteria

- Automated generation of migration scripts is successfully integrated into the development process.
- All migration scripts are version-controlled and seamlessly executed as part of the CI/CD pipeline.
- Rollback functionality is tested and verified to work as expected in various failure scenarios.
- The development team receives immediate notifications on the success or failure of migration processes.
- Documentation accurately reflects the database migration automation setup and process.

## 6. Dependencies

- Access to MeshHook's GitHub repository and CI/CD pipeline configuration.
- Selection and setup of a database migration tool that is compatible with Postgres.
- Collaboration with the development and operations teams for seamless integration and testing.

## 7. Implementation Notes

### Development Guidelines

- Adhere to MeshHook's coding standards and best practices throughout the development process.
- Ensure migration scripts are well-documented, including descriptions of their intended effects on the database schema.
- Adopt a Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach to validate the functionality and reliability of migration scripts.

### Testing Strategy

- **Unit Testing:** Verify the correctness of individual migration scripts in isolation.
- **Integration Testing:** Ensure that the migration process works as expected within the overall CI/CD workflow, particularly in a staging environment.
- **Rollback Testing:** Confirm that the rollback mechanism reliably returns the database to its previous state in the event of a migration failure.

### Security Considerations

- Exclude sensitive information from migration scripts, ensuring that no credentials or personal data are hardcoded.
- Follow MeshHook's security guidelines closely, particularly when handling or modifying data structures that contain sensitive information.

### Monitoring & Observability

- Implement comprehensive logging for all migration activities, recording successes, failures, and errors in detail.
- Establish alerting mechanisms to promptly notify the development team of any issues encountered during the migration process.
