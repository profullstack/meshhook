# PRD: Database Migration Automation

**Issue:** [#207](https://github.com/profullstack/meshhook/issues/207)  
**Milestone:** Phase 9: Deployment & Operations  
**Labels:** cicd, hacktoberfest  
**Phase:** Phase 9  
**Section:** CI/CD  

---

## Overview

The objective of this task is to automate the database migration process for MeshHook, ensuring seamless, error-free transitions between database schema versions as the platform evolves. This automation is critical for supporting MeshHook's ongoing development and deployment cycles, aligning with the project's goals of reliability, security, and maintainability.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

1. **Automation Tool Integration:** Integrate a database migration tool (e.g., Flyway, Liquibase, or a Postgres-native solution) into the CI/CD pipeline.
2. **Version Control for Database Schema:** Ensure all database schema changes are version-controlled, including tables, indexes, and RLS policies.
3. **Automatic Execution:** Migrations should run automatically as part of the deployment process, with no manual intervention required.
4. **Rollback Capability:** Provide a mechanism for rolling back to a previous database schema version in case of migration failure.
5. **Multi-Environment Support:** Support different environments (development, testing, production) with potentially different database configurations.

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** Ensure migrations do not significantly impact deployment times or application performance.
- **Reliability:** Automate error checks and provide alerts for migration failures.
- **Security:** Ensure all migration scripts follow security best practices, including the handling of sensitive data.
- **Maintainability:** Write clear, well-documented migration scripts that follow project conventions.

## Technical Specifications

### Architecture Context

MeshHook utilizes a Postgres database managed by Supabase, with the current schema defined in `schema.sql`. The automation of database migrations must integrate seamlessly with:

- The existing Supabase Postgres setup.
- The GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline currently in use for deployment.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Select a Migration Tool:** Choose an appropriate database migration tool that supports Postgres and integrates well with GitHub Actions.
2. **Setup Migration Scripts:** Convert existing database schema changes into migration scripts following the chosen tool's conventions.
3. **CI/CD Integration:** Update the GitHub Actions workflow to include a step for running database migrations automatically before the application is deployed.
4. **Environment Configuration:** Configure different environments in the migration tool to handle development, staging, and production databases.
5. **Rollback Strategy:** Implement a strategy for rolling back failed migrations, including clear documentation on how to trigger a rollback.

### Data Model Changes

- **Migration Scripts:** Each migration script represents a change or a set of changes to the database schema. These will be stored in a version-controlled directory.

### API Endpoints

- N/A for this task.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Database migration tool successfully integrated into the CI/CD pipeline.
- [ ] All existing database schema changes are converted into migration scripts.
- [ ] Database migrations run automatically during the deployment process.
- [ ] Rollback capability is tested and verified.
- [ ] Documentation updated with the migration process, including rollback instructions.

## Dependencies

- Access to the project's GitHub repository and CI/CD pipeline.
- Access to the Supabase project and database configurations.

## Implementation Notes

### Development Guidelines

- Choose a migration tool that is widely adopted and supported in the Postgres community.
- Migration scripts should be idempotent, ensuring they can be run multiple times without causing errors.
- Follow the established project structure and naming conventions for creating migration scripts.

### Testing Strategy

- **Unit Testing:** Not applicable for database migration scripts.
- **Integration Testing:** Test the integration of the migration tool in the CI/CD pipeline using a development database.
- **Manual Testing:** Perform manual migrations on a staging database to ensure correctness before deploying to production.

### Security Considerations

- Ensure migration scripts do not expose sensitive data.
- Use role-based access control in the CI/CD pipeline to limit who can modify migration scripts.

### Monitoring & Observability

- Configure alerts for migration failures in the CI/CD pipeline.
- Monitor the duration of migration steps to ensure they do not impact deployment times significantly.

## Related Documentation

- Existing `schema.sql` for current database schema.
- GitHub Actions documentation for CI/CD pipeline configurations.
- Selected database migration tool's official documentation for setup and usage instructions.
