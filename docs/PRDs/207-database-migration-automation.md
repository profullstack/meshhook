# PRD: Database Migration Automation

**Issue:** [#207 Database Migration Automation](https://github.com/profullstack/meshhook/issues/207)  
**Milestone:** Phase 9: Deployment & Operations  
**Labels:** cicd, hacktoberfest  
**Project:** MeshHook  

## 1. Overview

As MeshHook transitions into a more mature phase of deployment and operations, automating database migrations becomes pivotal. This process is essential for applying consistent database schema changes across different environments without manual intervention, thereby maintaining the integrity, reliability, and security of the data layer. This task aligns with MeshHook's foundational goals of providing a robust, scalable, and secure workflow engine.

### Purpose

The purpose of this task is to automate the process of database migrations within the MeshHook project, ensuring that schema changes are seamlessly integrated into the CI/CD pipeline, reducing the risk of human error and enhancing the project's operational efficiency.

## 2. Functional Requirements

1. **Automated Migration Script Generation:** Develop a system to automatically generate migration scripts for database schema changes.
2. **Version Control Integration:** Ensure that all migration scripts are version-controlled to track and manage schema changes across all environments.
3. **CI/CD Pipeline Execution:** Integrate the execution of migration scripts into the CI/CD pipeline, ensuring migrations are automatically applied during deployment.
4. **Rollback Capabilities:** Implement a robust rollback mechanism to revert to the previous stable state in case of migration failure.
5. **Notification and Reporting:** Develop a notification system to inform the development team about the success or failure of migrations.

## 3. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** Migration processes must be optimized to minimize downtime and not impact the overall performance of the application.
- **Reliability:** The migration system should automatically handle errors and provide a reliable rollback mechanism to prevent data loss.
- **Security:** Ensure migration scripts and processes adhere to MeshHook's stringent security guidelines, including the handling of sensitive data.
- **Maintainability:** The migration framework should be easily maintainable, with clear documentation and adherence to MeshHook's coding standards.

## 4. Technical Specifications

### Architecture Context

MeshHook uses a Postgres-native architecture, with SvelteKit/Svelte 5 for frontend operations and Supabase for backend services. The database migration automation must integrate with these technologies, with a particular focus on:

- **Supabase Postgres:** For direct interaction with the MeshHook database.
- **GitHub Actions:** For integrating migration scripts execution into the CI/CD pipeline.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Initial Setup:** Configure a database migration tool (e.g., Flyway or Liquibase) that is compatible with Postgres and supports the required automation features.
2. **Migration Scripts:** Develop a process to automatically generate or write migration scripts for schema changes. Scripts must be idempotent.
3. **CI/CD Integration:** Configure GitHub Actions (or equivalent) to automatically execute migration scripts as part of the deployment process.
4. **Rollback and Error Handling:** Implement error detection and a rollback system for migrations. Ensure that failed migrations trigger notifications and do not proceed to deployment.
5. **Monitoring and Notifications:** Set up a monitoring and notification system to inform the development team about the migration process's outcome.

### Data Model Changes

- **Migration Logs Table:** Introduce a new table to log executed migrations, including details like script name, execution date, status, and any errors encountered.

### API Endpoints

N/A - This task focuses on backend automation and does not introduce new API endpoints.

## 5. Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Automated migration scripts generation is implemented and tested.
- [ ] Migration scripts are version-controlled and integrated into the CI/CD pipeline.
- [ ] The rollback mechanism is in place and functional for handling migration failures.
- [ ] A notification system is implemented to inform the development team about migration outcomes.
- [ ] Documentation is updated to reflect the new database migration automation process.

## 6. Dependencies

- Access to MeshHook's codebase and CI/CD configurations.
- Selection of a database migration tool that supports Postgres and automation.
- Collaboration with the development team for the creation and testing of migration scripts.

## 7. Implementation Notes

### Development Guidelines

- Follow MeshHook's established coding standards and best practices.
- Ensure migration scripts are thoroughly commented and include documentation for maintenance.
- Utilize a Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach for creating migration scripts.

### Testing Strategy

- **Unit Testing:** For individual migration scripts, ensuring they perform as expected.
- **Integration Testing:** Conducted in a staging environment to validate that migrations integrate seamlessly into the deployment process.
- **Rollback Testing:** Ensure the rollback mechanism functions correctly in case of migration failure.

### Security Considerations

- Ensure no hard-coded credentials are present in migration scripts.
- Adhere to MeshHook's security guidelines for handling and migrating sensitive data.

### Monitoring & Observability

- Implement detailed logging for the migration process to capture execution status and errors.
- Set up alerts for migration failures to notify the development team promptly.
