# PRD: Database Migration Automation

**Issue:** [#207](https://github.com/profullstack/meshhook/issues/207)  
**Milestone:** Phase 9: Deployment & Operations  
**Labels:** cicd, hacktoberfest  
**Project:** MeshHook  

## Overview

In the deployment and operations phase of MeshHook, a critical requirement is to automate the process of database migrations. This task aligns with MeshHook’s goal to provide a robust, scalable, and secure workflow engine by ensuring that database schema changes are seamlessly applied across environments without manual intervention. Automating database migrations is crucial for maintaining data integrity, reducing downtime, and facilitating continuous delivery.

## Objectives

- To automate the application of database migrations as part of the CI/CD pipeline.
- To ensure database schema changes are version-controlled and applied consistently across all environments.
- To minimize the risk of data loss or schema conflicts during deployment.

## Functional Requirements

1. **Migration Script Generation:** Automatically generate migration scripts based on schema changes.
2. **Version Control for Migrations:** Integrate migration scripts into the version control system to track and apply schema changes.
3. **Automated Migration Execution:** Execute migration scripts automatically as part of the CI/CD pipeline during deployment.
4. **Rollback Mechanism:** Provide a mechanism to rollback failed migrations to the previous stable state.
5. **Notification System:** Notify the development team of the outcome of the migration process.

## Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** Ensure migration scripts are executed efficiently with minimal impact on application availability.
- **Reliability:** Automate error detection and rollback to prevent data loss or corruption.
- **Security:** Ensure that migration scripts do not expose sensitive data and comply with MeshHook’s security guidelines.
- **Maintainability:** Migration scripts and processes should be easy to maintain and update by the development team.

## Technical Specifications

### Architecture Context

MeshHook utilizes a Postgres-native architecture with components deployed across SvelteKit for frontend operations and Supabase for backend services. The database migration automation needs to integrate seamlessly with:

- **Supabase Postgres:** For executing migration scripts against the MeshHook database.
- **CI/CD Pipelines:** Integration with GitHub Actions (or similar) to trigger migrations as part of deployment.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Evaluation of Existing Schema:** Analyze the current database schema and configurations to establish a baseline for migrations.
2. **Tool Selection:** Choose an appropriate database migration tool that integrates with Postgres and supports automation (e.g., Flyway, Liquibase).
3. **Migration Script Development:** Develop migration scripts for schema changes. These scripts should be idempotent to ensure they can be safely rerun.
4. **Integration with CI/CD:** Configure the CI/CD pipeline to automatically trigger the migration process during the deployment phase.
5. **Testing:** Test the migration process in a staging environment to ensure safety and reliability.
6. **Monitoring and Notification:** Implement monitoring to track the status of migrations and set up notifications for the development team.

### Data Model

- **Migration Scripts Table:** A new table to log the details of executed migrations, including script name, execution date, status, and any errors.

### API Endpoints

- Not applicable for this task as it involves backend automation without direct API interactions.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Migration scripts are automatically generated for schema changes.
- [ ] Migration scripts are executed as part of the CI/CD pipeline.
- [ ] Rollback mechanisms are in place for failed migrations.
- [ ] The development team is notified of migration outcomes.
- [ ] Documentation is updated to include the migration process.
- [ ] All CI/CD checks pass with the new migration automation in place.

## Dependencies

- Access to the MeshHook codebase and CI/CD pipeline configurations.
- Selection and integration of a database migration tool.
- Coordination with the development team for migration script development and testing.

## Implementation Notes

### Development Guidelines

- Follow the established coding standards and best practices for the MeshHook project.
- Ensure all migration scripts are thoroughly commented and documented.
- Use the TDD approach for developing migration scripts when possible.

### Testing Strategy

- **Unit Testing:** For individual migration scripts to ensure they perform the expected schema changes.
- **Integration Testing:** In a staging environment to ensure migrations work as expected within the CI/CD pipeline.
- **Rollback Testing:** To verify the rollback mechanism works correctly in case of migration failure.

### Security Considerations

- Ensure migration scripts do not contain hard-coded credentials or expose sensitive data.
- Follow MeshHook’s security guidelines for database interactions and schema changes.

### Monitoring & Observability

- Implement logging for the migration process to track the execution status and errors.
- Set up alerts for migration failures to notify the development team promptly.
