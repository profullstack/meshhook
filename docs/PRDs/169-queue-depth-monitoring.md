# PRD: Queue Depth Monitoring for MeshHook

## 1. Overview

In the realm of workflow engines, monitoring the depth of job queues is paramount for maintaining system health and ensuring efficient operation. For MeshHook, implementing a robust queue depth monitoring system is essential to fulfill its objectives of providing a reliable, high-performance, and observably transparent workflow engine. This PRD outlines the requirements and approach for integrating queue depth monitoring into MeshHook's architecture, thereby enhancing its operational observability and reliability.

### Purpose

The primary purpose of this initiative is to develop a system within MeshHook that can continuously monitor and report the depth of various job queues, enabling the identification and mitigation of potential bottlenecks or system stress points before they impact performance or reliability.

### Alignment with Project Goals

Implementing queue depth monitoring directly supports MeshHook's core objectives:
- **Performance:** By monitoring queue depths, we can ensure that the system scales effectively under varying loads, maintaining optimal performance.
- **Reliability:** Early detection of queue depth anomalies will aid in preemptive problem-solving, enhancing system uptime.
- **Observability:** Enhancing internal state visibility allows for better operational insight and decision-making.

## 2. Functional Requirements

1. **Queue Depth Measurement:** The system must periodically measure and report the depth (the number of pending tasks) for each queue used by MeshHook.
2. **Configurable Reporting Frequency:** Administrators should be able to configure the frequency at which queue depths are reported.
3. **Threshold Alerts:** The system must allow for the configuration of queue depth thresholds that, when exceeded, will trigger alerts.
4. **Historical Data Management:** The system should store historical queue depth data to facilitate trend analysis and capacity planning.

## 3. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** The monitoring system must operate with minimal performance overhead, not detracting from the core functionalities of MeshHook.
- **Reliability:** This system should be highly reliable, ensuring continuous queue depth monitoring and reporting.
- **Security:** Implementations must adhere to MeshHook's security protocols, ensuring that monitoring mechanisms do not expose the system to new vulnerabilities.
- **Maintainability:** The system should be designed with maintainability in mind, following MeshHook's coding standards and practices.

## 4. Technical Specifications

### Architecture Context

MeshHook leverages **pg-boss** or **pgmq** for queue management, tightly integrated within its Supabase/Postgres ecosystem. The queue depth monitoring solution must seamlessly integrate with these components, utilizing existing infrastructure where possible to minimize architectural disruptions.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Component Design:**
   - Develop a metrics collection component capable of querying queue depths from **pg-boss** or **pgmq**.
   - Design a reporting interface, potentially integrating with MeshHook's existing dashboard or logging system, to display current queue depths.
   - Formulate a strategy for storing historical queue depth data, leveraging existing storage solutions if feasible.

2. **Integration and Development:**
   - Integrate the metrics collection component within MeshHook's architecture, ensuring it functions efficiently with minimal impact on overall system performance.
   - Implement database schema modifications for storing historical queue depth data, aligning with MeshHook's existing data model patterns.
   - Develop threshold-based alerting capabilities, utilizing MeshHook's existing alert mechanisms or integrating third-party services as necessary.

### Data Model Changes

- Introduction of a `queue_metrics` table, including fields for `timestamp`, `queue_name`, and `depth`, to store historical data regarding queue depths.

### API Endpoints

- **GET /api/metrics/queue-depth**: Retrieves current depth for all queues.
- **POST /api/metrics/queue-depth/alerts**: Configures alerts for specific queue depth thresholds.

## 5. Acceptance Criteria

- Accurate measurement and reporting of queue depths at predefined intervals.
- Ability to configure depth thresholds and receive alerts upon exceeding these thresholds.
- Historical queue depth data is stored and accessible for trend analysis.
- System performance impact is minimal, as demonstrated by benchmarks.
- Security review confirms the implementation complies with MeshHook's security guidelines.

## 6. Dependencies and Prerequisites

- **Technical Dependencies:** Access to the database and queue management systems (**pg-boss**/**pgmq**) is required.
- **Prerequisite Tasks:** An existing metrics infrastructure capable of supporting the additional data introduced by this feature.

## 7. Implementation Notes

### Development Guidelines

- Adhere to MeshHook's existing Node.js/JavaScript coding standards and architectural patterns.
- Ensure the new code is modular, testable, and integrates well with the existing metrics collection and reporting frameworks.

### Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests:** Cover functionality for queue depth measurement and reporting.
- **Integration Tests:** Validate integration with the queue management system and the effectiveness of the reporting/dashboarding features.

### Security Considerations

- Secure new API endpoints with MeshHook's existing authentication and authorization mechanisms.
- Apply RLS policies where applicable to maintain tenant data isolation.

### Monitoring and Observability

- Ensure integration of queue depth metrics into MeshHook's existing observability stack.
- Implement comprehensive logging for key actions and error conditions to aid in troubleshooting and operational monitoring.

By adhering to these guidelines and specifications, MeshHook will enhance its operational observability and reliability through effective queue depth monitoring.
