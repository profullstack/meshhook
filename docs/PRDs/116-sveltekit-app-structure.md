# PRD: SvelteKit App Structure for MeshHook

**Issue:** [#116](https://github.com/profullstack/meshhook/issues/116)  
**Milestone:** Phase 3: Frontend (SvelteKit)  
**Labels:** project-setup, hacktoberfest  
**Phase:** Phase 3  
**Section:** Project Setup  
**Author:** [Your Name]  
**Date:** [Today's Date]

## Overview

As MeshHook progresses into Phase 3, focusing on Frontend development using SvelteKit, establishing a robust and scalable app structure becomes paramount. This structure must support the project's core functionalities, including webhook triggers, a visual DAG builder, and live logs, all while ensuring high performance, reliability, and security. The SvelteKit app structure will lay the foundation for the frontend's development, facilitating future growth and maintenance.

### Objectives

- Define a scalable and maintainable SvelteKit app structure.
- Align with MeshHook's core goals and functionalities.
- Ensure the structure supports high performance, reliability, and security.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

1. **SvelteKit App Structure:** Establish a well-organized folder structure for the SvelteKit application, including but not limited to components, routes, stores, and services/modules.
2. **Component Library:** Setup a component library using Svelte 5 features, ensuring components are reusable, scalable, and easily maintainable.
3. **State Management:** Implement efficient state management practices to handle the application's state, particularly for user sessions and workflow data.
4. **Routing and Lazy Loading:** Design a routing system with support for lazy loading to enhance the application's performance.
5. **Integration Points:** Prepare the app structure for integration with backend services, including Supabase Realtime for live logs and Postgres-native functionalities.

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** The app structure must support sub-second response times for user interactions.
- **Reliability:** Aim for 99.9% uptime with robust error handling and recovery mechanisms.
- **Security:** Implement best practices for security, including proper handling of authentication, authorization, and data validation.
- **Maintainability:** The codebase should be clean, well-documented, and easy to understand, adhering to modern JavaScript and Svelte best practices.
- **Scalability:** The structure should be scalable, allowing for easy addition of new features and components.

## Technical Specifications

### Architecture Context

- **Frontend:** SvelteKit for SSR/API handling, focusing on user interaction, workflow management, and real-time updates.
- **Backend:** Supabase for database, real-time updates, and storage, integrating seamlessly with SvelteKit through API routes and services.
- **Integration Points:** The frontend will integrate closely with backend services for data fetching, user management, and live updates, following a RESTful API convention or GraphQL endpoints as required.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Analysis:** Evaluate existing frontend technologies and frameworks, choosing SvelteKit for its simplicity, performance, and the team's familiarity.
2. **Folder Structure:** Define a clear and logical folder structure, separating concerns such as routes, components, stores, and services.
3. **Component Design:** Develop a component library focusing on reusability and maintainability. Use Svelte 5 features for interactive and dynamic UI components.
4. **State Management:** Implement stores for managing global and local states efficiently, utilizing Svelte's built-in reactivity.
5. **Routing and Lazy Loading:** Configure SvelteKit's file-based routing and introduce code splitting and lazy loading for optimal performance.
6. **Integration:** Ensure seamless integration with backend services, setting up API routes and services in SvelteKit to communicate with Supabase.
7. **Testing and Documentation:** Write tests for major components and functionalities. Document the app structure and component usage guidelines.

### Data Model

No direct changes to the data model for this task. Future adjustments will be documented as required.

### API Endpoints

No new API endpoints are defined in this phase. The structure will accommodate existing and future API integrations.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] SvelteKit app structure defined and documented.
- [ ] Component library created with basic UI components.
- [ ] Efficient state management implemented.
- [ ] Routing configured with support for lazy loading.
- [ ] Seamless integration with backend services demonstrated.
- [ ] Performance, security, and reliability requirements met.
- [ ] Code documentation and guidelines provided.

## Dependencies

- Access to MeshHook's GitHub for codebase integration.
- Supabase project setup for backend services.
- SvelteKit and necessary npm packages installed.

## Implementation Notes

### Development Guidelines

- Follow the ESM module system and utilize modern JavaScript (ESNext) features.
- Implement error handling comprehensively, covering user input, server responses, and unexpected failures.
- Adhere to TDD practices where feasible, ensuring components and functions are well-tested.
- Ensure code quality by adhering to ESLint and Prettier configurations defined in the project.

### Testing Strategy

- **Unit Testing:** Utilize Jest or similar frameworks for testing individual components and utilities.
- **Integration Testing:** Test interactions between components and integration with backend services.
- **E2E Testing:** Use Playwright or Cypress for end-to-end testing of user flows.

### Security Considerations

- Implement CSRF and XSS protection measures.
- Ensure secure handling and storage of user authentication tokens.
- Validate all user inputs and sanitize outputs.

### Monitoring & Observability

- Integrate logging mechanisms to capture errors and performance bottlenecks.
- Utilize browser performance APIs to monitor and optimize frontend performance.
