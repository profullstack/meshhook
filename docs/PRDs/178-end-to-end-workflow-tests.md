# PRD: End-to-end Workflow Tests for MeshHook

## Overview

This PRD outlines the approach for implementing end-to-end (E2E) workflow tests for the MeshHook project. This task is instrumental in ensuring that MeshHook delivers on its promise of providing a reliable, efficient, and secure workflow engine. E2E tests are designed to simulate real-world usage, ensuring that the system operates as expected under various conditions and workflows. This initiative aligns with MeshHook's goals of durability, security, and ease of use, significantly contributing to the project's overall quality assurance strategy.

## Functional Requirements

1. **E2E Test Suite Creation**: Develop a comprehensive suite of E2E tests that cover all major functionalities of MeshHook, including webhook triggers, DAG execution, event sourcing, live logging, and multi-tenant security.
2. **Workflow Simulation**: Tests must simulate real-world workflows, including complex DAG configurations, failure and retry scenarios, and multi-tenant use cases.
3. **Signature Verification Testing**: Include tests for webhook signature verification to ensure security mechanisms are correctly implemented.
4. **Visual DAG Builder Testing**: Ensure the visual DAG builder functions as expected, allowing users to create, edit, and publish workflows without issues.
5. **Event Sourcing and Replayability**: Test the durability and accuracy of event sourcing mechanisms, including the ability to replay runs for debugging and auditing.
6. **Live Logging Verification**: Validate the functionality of live logs, ensuring logs are accurate, timely, and secure.

## Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance**: E2E tests should not significantly impact system performance. Test execution should be optimized for speed and efficiency.
- **Reliability**: Tests must be reliable, with consistent results across repeated runs. Flaky tests must be identified and fixed promptly.
- **Security**: Testing must not expose the system or data to security risks. Use secure, isolated environments for testing.
- **Maintainability**: The test suite should be easy to maintain, with clear documentation and straightforward mechanisms for adding new tests.

## Technical Specifications

### Architecture Context

MeshHook utilizes a combination of SvelteKit, Supabase, and worker processes for its operations. The testing architecture should integrate seamlessly with these components, leveraging existing infrastructure for test execution.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Assessment**: Review the current system and test coverage to identify gaps and areas requiring E2E testing.
2. **Tool Selection**: Choose appropriate tools for E2E testing that integrate well with the MeshHook stack (e.g., Cypress, Puppeteer).
3. **Test Development**:
   - Develop tests incrementally, starting with critical paths.
   - Use mock data and isolated environments to simulate real-world scenarios.
4. **Integration**: Integrate the E2E test suite into the CI/CD pipeline, ensuring tests run automatically on major updates.
5. **Monitoring and Iteration**: Monitor test results, adjusting and expanding the test suite as necessary to cover new features and scenarios.

### Data Model

No changes to the data model are required for the implementation of E2E tests. Tests should use separate testing databases or schemas to avoid impacting production data.

### API Endpoints

No new API endpoints are required. Testing should utilize existing endpoints, ensuring they function correctly across various scenarios.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] E2E test suite fully covers all major functionalities and workflows.
- [ ] Tests simulate real-world scenarios, including complex workflows and error conditions.
- [ ] All tests pass consistently, with no flaky results.
- [ ] Test suite integrates seamlessly with the CI/CD pipeline.
- [ ] Documentation is updated to include information on running and extending the E2E test suite.

## Dependencies and Prerequisites

- Access to MeshHook development and testing environments.
- Selection and setup of E2E testing tools compatible with the MeshHook stack.
- Existing unit and integration test suites are in place and passing.

## Implementation Notes

### Development Guidelines

- Follow MeshHook's coding standards and best practices.
- Implement tests in a scalable and maintainable manner, ensuring ease of adding new tests as MeshHook evolves.
- Ensure tests are well-documented, explaining the purpose and expected outcomes.

### Testing Strategy

- Utilize a combination of mocking and real data to simulate various operational scenarios.
- Incorporate tests for both happy paths and failure modes, ensuring the system gracefully handles errors.
- Prioritize testing of critical paths and security features.

### Security Considerations

- Ensure testing environments are secure and isolated from production.
- Use encrypted connections and handle sensitive data (e.g., webhook signatures) securely.
- Follow best practices for authentication and authorization in tests, ensuring no security holes are introduced.

### Monitoring & Observability

- Implement logging and monitoring within the test suite to identify issues quickly.
- Monitor test execution times and resource usage, optimizing as necessary to avoid performance bottlenecks.
