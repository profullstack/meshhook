# PRD: Backup Strategy

**Issue:** [#200](https://github.com/profullstack/meshhook/issues/200)  
**Milestone:** Phase 9: Deployment & Operations  
**Labels:** production-readiness  
**Phase:** Phase 9  
**Section:** Production Readiness

## Overview

In the pursuit of enhancing the operational robustness and data integrity of the MeshHook platform, a comprehensive backup strategy is crucial. This strategy will ensure the protection of critical data against accidental loss, corruption, and facilitate disaster recovery. It aligns with MeshHook's commitment to reliability, security, and maintainability, safeguarding webhook triggers, DAG workflows, event-sourced runs, and multi-tenant security configurations.

**Objective:** Develop and implement a backup strategy for the MeshHook platform, focusing on Postgres-native data, configurations, and essential artifacts.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

1. **Automated Backups:** Implement automated backups for all Postgres databases, including workflow definitions, event logs, and tenant configurations.
2. **Backup Frequency and Retention:** Configure daily backups with a retention policy of 30 days, ensuring a balance between data availability and storage management.
3. **Backup Validation:** Implement a process to validate the integrity of backups periodically, ensuring they are complete and can be restored successfully.
4. **Disaster Recovery Plan:** Document a detailed disaster recovery plan, outlining steps for data restoration in different scenarios (e.g., partial data loss, complete outage).
5. **Multi-Tenant Data Isolation:** Ensure backups respect multi-tenant data isolation, maintaining RLS and encryption guarantees.

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** Minimize performance impact during backup operations, ensuring user-facing operations are not adversely affected.
- **Reliability:** Achieve high reliability in backup and restore operations, targeting a success rate of 99.9%.
- **Security:** Secure backup data using encryption at rest and in transit, with access controls to prevent unauthorized access.
- **Maintainability:** Automate backup and validation processes to minimize manual intervention and reduce the risk of human error.

## Technical Specifications

### Architecture Context

MeshHook utilizes Supabase, leveraging Postgres for data storage. The backup strategy must integrate seamlessly with this setup and the broader architecture, including:

- **Supabase Postgres:** The primary data store for workflows, event logs, and tenant data.
- **Supabase Storage:** Potential storage destination for backup archives.
- **External Backup Solutions:** Consideration for third-party backup services or tools that offer enhanced features like incremental backups and point-in-time recovery.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Evaluation:** Assess current database size, growth rate, and critical data segments to tailor the backup strategy effectively.
2. **Tool Selection:** Choose appropriate tools for database backups. Consider pg_dump for full backups and pg_basebackup or third-party tools for incremental backups and point-in-time recovery capabilities.
3. **Backup Script Development:** Develop scripts to automate the backup process, including data encryption, storage, and periodic validation checks.
4. **Disaster Recovery Documentation:** Create comprehensive documentation outlining the process for restoring data from backups in various disaster scenarios.
5. **Monitoring and Alerts:** Integrate backup processes with the existing monitoring system to track backup success/failure and alert the operations team as necessary.

### Data Model

No changes to the existing data model are required specifically for backup operations. However, monitoring and logging tables may be introduced to track backup status and integrity checks.

### API Endpoints

N/A. This task focuses on backend processes without exposing new API endpoints.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Automated backup processes implemented for all critical data stores.
- [ ] Backup integrity validation process in place and periodically tested.
- [ ] Disaster recovery documentation completed and accessible to the team.
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting for backup operations integrated with the existing system.
- [ ] Backup and restore operations tested in a staged environment to confirm reliability and integrity.

## Dependencies

- Access to Supabase and administrative credentials.
- Availability of external storage or third-party services for storing backups, if applicable.

## Implementation Notes

### Development Guidelines

- Follow existing coding standards and best practices for scripting and automation.
- Ensure scripts are idempotent and can be safely rerun without duplicating or corrupting data.
- Document all scripts and processes thoroughly.

### Testing Strategy

- **Unit Testing:** For any new code or scripts developed, ensure functionality is covered by unit tests.
- **Recovery Testing:** Periodically perform recovery from backups in a non-production environment to verify integrity and document the process.

### Security Considerations

- Encrypt backup data both at rest and in transit.
- Implement strict access controls and audit logs for backup and restore operations.

### Monitoring & Observability

- Integrate backup processes with existing monitoring tools to track success, failure, and performance metrics.
- Set up alerts for failed backups or validation checks to ensure immediate attention to potential issues.
