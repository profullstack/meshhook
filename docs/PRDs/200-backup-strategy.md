# PRD: Backup Strategy for MeshHook

## Overview

The integration of a comprehensive backup strategy is critical as MeshHook moves toward production readiness. This strategy is designed to ensure the durability of data, reliability of the system, and continuity of operations, aligning with MeshHook’s architectural principles and the broader objectives of providing a deterministic, Postgres-native workflow engine with multi-tenant RLS security. The goal is to develop and implement a backup strategy that guarantees data integrity, enables rapid restoration with minimal downtime, and adheres to the project’s performance, security, and multi-tenancy requirements.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

1. **Automated Backups:** Implement scheduled, automated backups of the entire Postgres database, capturing all relevant data for MeshHook operations.
2. **Incremental Backups:** Facilitate incremental backups to manage data volumes efficiently and reduce storage costs.
3. **Backup Integrity Checks:** Periodically validate backup integrity to ensure data completeness and recoverability.
4. **Secure Storage:** Encrypt backups and store them securely, following MeshHook's security protocols.
5. **Rapid Restoration:** Establish a documented, streamlined process for quick data restoration from backups with minimal operational disruption.
6. **Tenant Data Isolation:** Ensure the backup and restoration processes are compliant with MeshHook’s multi-tenant RLS security model, maintaining strict data isolation across tenants.

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** The backup strategy should minimally impact live operations, particularly maintaining user-facing operations' responsiveness.
- **Reliability:** Target 99.9% uptime, with the backup strategy enhancing the system's overall robustness.
- **Security:** Follow strict guidelines for data encryption, both in transit and at rest, and adhere to access control measures.
- **Maintainability:** Ensure the backup system is scalable, easily maintained, and compatible with future updates to MeshHook.

## Technical Specifications

### Architecture Context

MeshHook utilizes SvelteKit for SSR/API operations, Supabase for database and real-time functionalities, and dedicated workers for orchestration and HTTP execution. The backup strategy must be seamlessly integrated with these components, particularly focusing on the efficient backup of the Postgres database managed by Supabase.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Analysis:** Review the existing database schema and data volumes to customize the backup strategy.
2. **Design:**
   - Select appropriate tools and services for executing backup operations, with a focus on compatibility with Supabase and Postgres.
   - Determine the backup schedule, considering data recovery objectives and operational loads.
   - Outline encryption methods and protocols for secure backup storage.
3. **Implementation:**
   - Set up automated backup jobs, incorporating incremental backup mechanisms.
   - Develop routines for backup integrity checks.
   - Implement secure storage practices, using encryption and access controls.
   - Create comprehensive documentation for the data restoration process.
4. **Testing:** Validate the backup and restoration procedures through simulated failure scenarios.
5. **Documentation:** Provide detailed backup and restoration guidelines within the MeshHook documentation.

### Data Model and API Endpoints

- **Data Model Changes:** None required specifically for the backup strategy. However, documenting the backup structure and restoration procedures is essential.
- **API Endpoints:** Backup operations will be managed internally; no new API endpoints are needed.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Automated backup system is fully operational.
- Incremental backup functionality is verified to be effective.
- Backup integrity checks are routinely performed and confirmed.
- Backups are securely encrypted and stored, adhering to MeshHook’s security standards.
- The data restoration process is thoroughly documented, with proven minimal operational impact.
- Tenant data isolation is maintained in compliance with the multi-tenant RLS security model.

## Dependencies

### Technical Dependencies

- Access to Supabase for Postgres configurations.
- Backup and encryption tools that are compatible with the Supabase and Postgres setup.
- Secure storage solutions for encrypted backup files.

### Prerequisite Tasks

- Update MeshHook’s security guidelines to encompass backup and restoration processes.
- Ensure existing data complies with MeshHook’s data handling and privacy standards.

## Implementation Notes

### Development Guidelines

- Follow MeshHook’s coding standards and best practices rigorously.
- Log all backup operations for auditing and monitoring purposes.

### Testing Strategy

- Perform unit and integration tests for backup functionality and integrity checks.
- Conduct comprehensive restoration tests in a staged environment to ensure accuracy and minimal disruption.

### Security Considerations

- Utilize AES-256 encryption for securing backups, both during transit and while at rest.
- Implement stringent access controls and authentication mechanisms for all backup and restoration activities.

### Monitoring & Observability

- Integrate backup operations within MeshHook’s existing monitoring framework.
- Establish alerts for backup failures, integrity check failures, and unauthorized access attempts.
