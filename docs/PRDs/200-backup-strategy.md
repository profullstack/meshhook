## Overview

<<<<<<< HEAD
As MeshHook transitions to a production-ready state, establishing a robust backup strategy is paramount to ensure data durability, system reliability, and operational continuity. This task seeks to integrate a comprehensive backup strategy that aligns with MeshHook's architectural principles, focusing on Postgres-native workflows, multi-tenant RLS security, and the overarching goals outlined in the project's objectives.

**Objective:** Develop and implement a backup strategy that ensures data integrity, minimizes downtime, and supports rapid restoration, all while maintaining compliance with MeshHook's performance, security, and multi-tenancy requirements.
=======
In the pursuit of enhancing the operational robustness and data integrity of the MeshHook platform, a comprehensive backup strategy is crucial. This strategy will ensure the protection of critical data against accidental loss, corruption, and facilitate disaster recovery. It aligns with MeshHook's commitment to reliability, security, and maintainability, safeguarding webhook triggers, DAG workflows, event-sourced runs, and multi-tenant security configurations.

**Objective:** Develop and implement a backup strategy for the MeshHook platform, focusing on Postgres-native data, configurations, and essential artifacts.

## Technical Specifications

### Architecture Context

<<<<<<< HEAD
MeshHook's architecture leverages SvelteKit for SSR/API operations, Supabase for database and real-time functionalities, and dedicated workers for orchestration and HTTP execution. The backup strategy must integrate seamlessly with these components, particularly focusing on the Postgres database managed by Supabase.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Analysis:** Evaluate current database schema and data volume to tailor the backup strategy effectively.
2. **Design:**
   - Select tools and services for backup operations, considering integration with Supabase and Postgres.
   - Design the backup schedule, balancing frequency with system load and data recovery objectives.
   - Define encryption methods for secure backup storage.
3. **Implementation:**
   - Configure automated backup jobs, including incremental backup mechanisms.
   - Implement backup validation routines to ensure data integrity.
   - Secure backup storage, using encryption and access controls.
   - Document the restoration process, including steps for rapid recovery and multi-tenant data handling.
4. **Testing:** Simulate failure scenarios to validate backup integrity and restoration procedures.
5. **Documentation:** Update MeshHook documentation to include detailed backup and restoration guidelines.

### Data Model

No direct changes to the application data model are required for the implementation of the backup strategy. However, documentation on the structure of backups and restoration procedures will be vital for maintenance and operational readiness.

### API Endpoints

No new API endpoints are required for this task. Backup operations will be managed internally and through administrative interfaces.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Automated backup system implemented and operational.
- [ ] Incremental backup capabilities in place and verified.
- [ ] Backup validation mechanisms operational and periodically tested.
- [ ] Backups securely stored with encryption, following MeshHook's security guidelines.
- [ ] Documentation for backup and restoration processes completed and accessible.
- [ ] Restoration process tested, with minimal impact on operations and guaranteed data integrity.
- [ ] Multi-tenant data isolation maintained throughout the backup and restoration processes.

## Dependencies

### Technical Dependencies

- Access to Supabase and Postgres configurations.
- Backup and encryption tools compatible with Supabase and Postgres environments.
- Secure storage solutions for encrypted backups.

### Prerequisite Tasks

- Review and update security guidelines to include backup and restoration processes.
- Ensure all existing data is compliant with MeshHook's data handling and privacy policies.
=======
MeshHook utilizes Supabase, leveraging Postgres for data storage. The backup strategy must integrate seamlessly with this setup and the broader architecture, including:

- **Supabase Postgres:** The primary data store for workflows, event logs, and tenant data.
- **Supabase Storage:** Potential storage destination for backup archives.
- **External Backup Solutions:** Consideration for third-party backup services or tools that offer enhanced features like incremental backups and point-in-time recovery.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Evaluation:** Assess current database size, growth rate, and critical data segments to tailor the backup strategy effectively.
2. **Tool Selection:** Choose appropriate tools for database backups. Consider pg_dump for full backups and pg_basebackup or third-party tools for incremental backups and point-in-time recovery capabilities.
3. **Backup Script Development:** Develop scripts to automate the backup process, including data encryption, storage, and periodic validation checks.
4. **Disaster Recovery Documentation:** Create comprehensive documentation outlining the process for restoring data from backups in various disaster scenarios.
5. **Monitoring and Alerts:** Integrate backup processes with the existing monitoring system to track backup success/failure and alert the operations team as necessary.

### Data Model

No changes to the existing data model are required specifically for backup operations. However, monitoring and logging tables may be introduced to track backup status and integrity checks.

### API Endpoints

N/A. This task focuses on backend processes without exposing new API endpoints.

## Acceptance Criteria
