# PRD: Backup Strategy

**Issue:** [#200](https://github.com/profullstack/meshhook/issues/200)  
**Milestone:** Phase 9: Deployment & Operations  
**Labels:** production-readiness, hacktoberfest  
**Phase:** Phase 9  
**Section:** Production Readiness

## Overview

As MeshHook transitions to a production-ready state, establishing a robust backup strategy is paramount to ensure data durability, system reliability, and operational continuity. This task seeks to integrate a comprehensive backup strategy that aligns with MeshHook's architectural principles, focusing on Postgres-native workflows, multi-tenant RLS security, and the overarching goals outlined in the project's objectives.

**Objective:** Develop and implement a backup strategy that ensures data integrity, minimizes downtime, and supports rapid restoration, all while maintaining compliance with MeshHook's performance, security, and multi-tenancy requirements.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

1. **Automated Backups:** Implement automated, scheduled backups of the entire Postgres database, including all tables and schemas relevant to MeshHook operations.
2. **Incremental Backups:** Support incremental backups to efficiently manage data volume and reduce storage requirements.
3. **Backup Validation:** Include mechanisms to validate the integrity of backups periodically.
4. **Secure Backup Storage:** Ensure backups are encrypted and stored securely, in compliance with MeshHook's security guidelines.
5. **Rapid Restoration:** Provide a clear, documented process for rapid restoration of data from backups, with minimal downtime.
6. **Multi-Tenant Data Isolation:** Respect multi-tenant RLS security in backup and restoration processes, ensuring tenant data isolation.

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** Ensure the backup process minimizes impact on live operations, maintaining sub-second response times for user-facing operations.
- **Reliability:** Achieve 99.9% uptime, with backup strategies contributing to overall system resilience.
- **Security:** Adhere to MeshHook's security guidelines, including encryption in transit and at rest, and access controls for backup operations.
- **Maintainability:** Design the backup system for easy maintenance, scalability, and integration with future MeshHook updates.

## Technical Specifications

### Architecture Context

MeshHook's architecture leverages SvelteKit for SSR/API operations, Supabase for database and real-time functionalities, and dedicated workers for orchestration and HTTP execution. The backup strategy must integrate seamlessly with these components, particularly focusing on the Postgres database managed by Supabase.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Analysis:** Evaluate current database schema and data volume to tailor the backup strategy effectively.
2. **Design:**
   - Select tools and services for backup operations, considering integration with Supabase and Postgres.
   - Design the backup schedule, balancing frequency with system load and data recovery objectives.
   - Define encryption methods for secure backup storage.
3. **Implementation:**
   - Configure automated backup jobs, including incremental backup mechanisms.
   - Implement backup validation routines to ensure data integrity.
   - Secure backup storage, using encryption and access controls.
   - Document the restoration process, including steps for rapid recovery and multi-tenant data handling.
4. **Testing:** Simulate failure scenarios to validate backup integrity and restoration procedures.
5. **Documentation:** Update MeshHook documentation to include detailed backup and restoration guidelines.

### Data Model

No direct changes to the application data model are required for the implementation of the backup strategy. However, documentation on the structure of backups and restoration procedures will be vital for maintenance and operational readiness.

### API Endpoints

No new API endpoints are required for this task. Backup operations will be managed internally and through administrative interfaces.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Automated backup system implemented and operational.
- [ ] Incremental backup capabilities in place and verified.
- [ ] Backup validation mechanisms operational and periodically tested.
- [ ] Backups securely stored with encryption, following MeshHook's security guidelines.
- [ ] Documentation for backup and restoration processes completed and accessible.
- [ ] Restoration process tested, with minimal impact on operations and guaranteed data integrity.
- [ ] Multi-tenant data isolation maintained throughout the backup and restoration processes.

## Dependencies

### Technical Dependencies

- Access to Supabase and Postgres configurations.
- Backup and encryption tools compatible with Supabase and Postgres environments.
- Secure storage solutions for encrypted backups.

### Prerequisite Tasks

- Review and update security guidelines to include backup and restoration processes.
- Ensure all existing data is compliant with MeshHook's data handling and privacy policies.

## Implementation Notes

### Development Guidelines

- Adhere to MeshHook's coding standards and best practices.
- Ensure all backup operations are logged and monitored for auditing purposes.

### Testing Strategy

- Implement unit and integration tests for backup and validation functions.
- Conduct full restoration tests in a staging environment to ensure minimal impact on live operations.

### Security Considerations

- Implement AES-256 encryption for backups, both in transit and at rest.
- Ensure strict access controls and authentication for backup and restoration operations.

### Monitoring & Observability

- Integrate backup operations into MeshHook's existing monitoring systems.
- Set up alerts for backup failures, validation errors, and unauthorized access attempts.
