# PRD: Compliance Helpers

**Issue:** [#151](https://github.com/profullstack/meshhook/issues/151)  
**Milestone:** Phase 4: Security  
**Labels:** pii-redaction, hacktoberfest  
**Phase:** Phase 4  
**Section:** PII & Redaction  

---

## Overview

The objective of this task is to enhance MeshHook's security posture by introducing compliance helpers focused on Personally Identifiable Information (PII) redaction. It aligns with our goals of maintaining high security and privacy standards, and ensuring that MeshHook remains a versatile and compliant workflow engine for developers handling sensitive data. This feature is critical for users in regulated industries and geographies with stringent data protection laws.

## Functional Requirements

1. **PII Detection and Redaction:**
   - Automatically detect PII in webhook payloads and workflow logs.
   - Implement configurable redaction strategies (masking, hashing, removal).

2. **Compliance Policies:**
   - Allow users to define, at the project level, what constitutes PII.
   - Support predefined PII types (e.g., email, phone number, credit card number) and custom patterns (regex).

3. **Audit and Reporting:**
   - Generate reports on redaction activities and occurrences of PII for audits.
   - Provide an audit trail for changes to compliance policies.

4. **User Interface:**
   - Visual interface for configuring PII detection rules and redaction methods.
   - Real-time feedback on detected PII within the DAG editor and test runs.

5. **API Extensions:**
   - Offer API endpoints for managing compliance policies and retrieving audit logs.

## Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** Ensure that PII detection and redaction processes do not significantly impact workflow execution times.
- **Security:** Compliance helpers must adhere to the highest security standards to prevent accidental PII exposure.
- **Reliability:** Guarantee robust detection of PII across various data formats and structures with minimal false positives/negatives.
- **Maintainability:** Design the feature to be easily extendable with new PII types and compliance regulations.

## Technical Specifications

### Architecture Context

MeshHook's architecture, utilizing SvelteKit for the front end and Supabase (Postgres, Realtime) for the backend, demands that compliance helpers are seamlessly integrated without disrupting existing functionalities. PII detection should be implemented as a layer within the webhook intake process and the logging mechanism.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Analysis:** Assess current data flow for webhook payloads and logs to identify integration points for PII detection.
2. **Design:**
   - Define data structures for compliance policies.
   - Design the API contracts for managing policies and audit logs.
   - Architect the PII detection mechanism to be performant and reliable.
3. **Implementation:** 
   - Develop the PII detection and redaction engine.
   - Create the UI for compliance policy management.
   - Extend the API for policy and audit log interactions.
4. **Integration:** Plug the compliance helpers into the webhook processing and logging pathways.
5. **Testing:** Perform rigorous testing, focusing on detection accuracy and system performance.
6. **Documentation:** Document the feature in user guides and API references.
7. **Review:** Conduct code and functionality reviews with the team.

### Data Model Changes

- `CompliancePolicies`: New table to store user-defined PII detection rules and redaction methods.
- `AuditLogs`: Extend the existing table to include entries for compliance policy modifications and PII redaction actions.

### API Endpoints

- `POST /api/compliance/policies`: Create or update compliance policies.
- `GET /api/compliance/policies/{projectId}`: Retrieve compliance policies for a project.
- `GET /api/compliance/audit-logs/{projectId}`: Fetch audit logs related to compliance actions.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] PII detection and redaction functionality implemented as specified.
- [ ] Compliance policies are configurable via both UI and API.
- [ ] Audit logs accurately reflect policy changes and redaction actions.
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met for detection and redaction processes.
- [ ] Comprehensive tests validate functionality, security, and performance.
- [ ] Documentation is clear, concise, and complete.
- [ ] Feature passes security audit with no significant issues.

## Dependencies

### Technical Dependencies

- Integration with existing database schema and API.
- Access to regex libraries or services capable of PII pattern recognition.

### Prerequisite Tasks

- Review of current data handling practices and legal requirements for PII.

## Implementation Notes

### Development Guidelines

- Prioritize security and efficiency in PII detection algorithms.
- Ensure backward compatibility for existing workflows and data.
- Use feature flags for gradual rollout and testing.

### Testing Strategy

- Unit and integration tests for detection logic and API endpoints.
- Performance testing to assess impact on workflow execution times.
- Security testing focused on potential data leaks or exposure.

### Security Considerations

- All PII detection and handling operations must be performed securely, ensuring that sensitive information is neither logged nor exposed.
- Compliance policies should be accessible only to authorized users.

### Monitoring & Observability

- Implement monitoring for the performance of the PII detection system.
- Alerting for system anomalies or operational issues related to compliance helpers.

## Related Documentation

- Updated [Security Guidelines](../Security.md) with PII handling practices.
- API documentation for managing compliance policies and retrieving audit logs.
