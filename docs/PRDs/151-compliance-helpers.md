# PRD: Compliance Helpers for MeshHook

**Issue:** [#151](https://github.com/profullstack/meshhook/issues/151)  
**Milestone:** Phase 4: Security  
**Labels:** pii-redaction, hacktoberfest

---

## 1. Overview

In Phase 4 of MeshHook's development, the focus shifts towards enhancing the platform's security capabilities to ensure compliance with global data protection standards. The addition of Compliance Helpers aims to automate the detection and redaction of Personally Identifiable Information (PII) within webhook payloads and workflow logs. This feature aligns with MeshHook's commitment to providing a secure, privacy-conscious workflow engine, catering especially to users in regulated industries where PII handling is subject to strict legal frameworks.

## 2. Functional Requirements

1. **PII Detection and Redaction:** Implement a system capable of identifying PII in both incoming webhook payloads and workflow-generated logs, applying configurable redaction strategies (e.g., masking, hashing, complete removal).

2. **Compliance Policy Management:** Users should be able to define what constitutes PII within their project's context, leveraging both predefined types (such as emails and credit card numbers) and custom regex patterns for more specific needs.

3. **Audit Trails and Reporting:** Ensure that all actions related to PII detection, redaction, and policy amendments are logged comprehensively, supporting auditability and reporting needs.

4. **User Interface Enhancements:** Provide a user-friendly interface for setting up and managing PII detection rules and redaction methods, integrated seamlessly within the existing DAG editor for real-time feedback.

5. **API Extensions:** Introduce new API endpoints to facilitate programmatic management of compliance policies and access to audit logs, enhancing MeshHook's automation capabilities.

## 3. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** The introduction of PII detection and redaction must not cause noticeable delays in workflow execution or webhook processing.
- **Security:** Implement the feature with the highest security standards, ensuring that sensitive data is handled and processed securely, with no room for accidental exposure.
- **Reliability:** Achieve high accuracy in detecting PII, minimizing false positives and negatives, across various data formats and structures.
- **Maintainability:** Design the system to be easily updatable, accommodating future expansions in PII types and compliance requirements without significant rework.

## 4. Technical Specifications

### Architecture Context

Given MeshHook's existing architecture, integrating Compliance Helpers necessitates minimal disruption to current functionalities. The PII detection system should act as an intermediary layer within the webhook processing pipeline and the logging mechanism, leveraging SvelteKit for frontend updates and Supabase for backend logic and real-time updates.

### Implementation Approach

1. **Analysis:** Review the current data handling processes to pinpoint where PII detection and redaction can be most effectively integrated.
2. **Design:**
   - Specify the data models for storing compliance policies.
   - Outline the API contracts for policy management and access to audit logs.
   - Architect the detection engine to ensure performance and reliability.
3. **Implementation:** Develop the detection engine, user interface for policy management, and extend the API for new functionality.
4. **Integration:** Incorporate the Compliance Helpers into the existing processing and logging pathways.
5. **Testing:** Conduct thorough testing with a focus on detection accuracy, system performance, and security.
6. **Documentation:** Update user guides and API reference materials to include the new features.
7. **Review:** Engage with the MeshHook team for code and functionality reviews.

### Data Model Changes

- Introduce a `CompliancePolicies` table to capture user-defined PII detection rules and redaction methods.
- Extend the `AuditLogs` table to include compliance-related actions.

### API Endpoints

- `POST /api/compliance/policies`: Endpoint for creating or updating compliance policies.
- `GET /api/compliance/policies/{projectId}`: Retrieves the compliance policies for a given project.
- `GET /api/compliance/audit-logs/{projectId}`: Accesses audit logs specific to compliance actions within a project.

## 5. Acceptance Criteria

- The system accurately detects and redacts PII in accordance with user-defined policies.
- Users can configure and manage compliance policies through both the UI and API.
- Audit logs reflect all compliance-related actions accurately.
- PII detection and redaction processes meet predefined performance benchmarks.
- Comprehensive testing validates functionality, security, and performance adherence.
- Documentation is updated to reflect the new features comprehensively.
- The feature undergoes and passes a security audit without significant findings.

## 6. Dependencies

### Technical Dependencies

- Integration with current database schema and API infrastructure.
- Utilization of regex libraries or services for effective PII pattern detection.

### Prerequisite Tasks

- Comprehensive review of existing data handling practices for PII.
- Legal consultation to ensure compliance with relevant data protection laws.

## 7. Implementation Notes

### Development Guidelines

- Prioritize security and data privacy in the design and implementation phases.
- Ensure that the feature is backward compatible with existing workflows.
- Implement feature flags for a controlled rollout and easier rollback if necessary.

### Testing Strategy

- Employ unit and integration tests for new logic and API endpoints.
- Conduct performance tests to evaluate the impact on processing times.
- Perform security assessments focused on potential data exposure risks.

### Security Considerations

- Secure all operations involving PII to prevent unintended data exposure.
- Restrict access to compliance policies to authorized personnel only.

### Monitoring & Observability

- Monitor the performance and reliability of the PII detection system.
- Set up alerting mechanisms for operational issues or anomalies related to Compliance Helpers.

By addressing the requirements outlined in this PRD, MeshHook will significantly enhance its security offerings, making it a more attractive solution for handling workflows that involve sensitive data, and ensuring compliance with global data protection standards.
