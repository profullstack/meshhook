## Current Sprint Focus

**Environment Setup** ‚úÖ COMPLETE
- All environment configuration completed
- Supabase CLI integrated
- Documentation updated

**Next Up: Phase 1 - Core Infrastructure**
- Start with database schema design
- Implement core tables with RLS
- Set up queue system (pg-boss recommended)

---

## Notes

- Follow KISS principle - keep it simple
- Use Supabase CLI for all migrations (`pnpx supabase migration new`)
- All tests go in `./tests` directory
- Port 8080 for all services
- Event sourcing is key for determinism and replay
- JMESPath for transforms (no arbitrary code execution in v1)
